10.1038/s41422-020-0353-2	FALSE	FALSE	Reconstruction of cell spatial organization from single-cell RNA sequencing data based on ligand-receptor mediated self-assembly	2020-06-15	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized transcriptomic studies by providing unprecedented cellular and molecular throughputs, but spatial information of individual cells is lost during tissue dissociation. While imaging-based technologies such as in situ sequencing show great promise, technical difficulties currently limit their wide usage. Here we hypothesize that cellular spatial organization is inherently encoded by cell identity and can be reconstructed, at least in part, by ligand-receptor interactions, and we present CSOmap, a computational tool to infer cellular interaction de novo from scRNA-seq. We show that CSOmap can successfully recapitulate the spatial organization of multiple organs of human and mouse including tumor microenvironments for multiple cancers in pseudo-space, and reveal molecular determinants of cellular interactions. Further, CSOmap readily simulates perturbation of genes or cell types to gain novel biological insights, especially into how immune cells interact in the tumor microenvironment. CSOmap can be a widely applicable tool to interrogate cellular organizations based on scRNA-seq data for various tissues in diverse systems.	468	1.2813141683778233	6	47	22	0.04700854700854701	3.6

Vision operates directly on the manifold of cell-cell similarity and employs a flexible annotation approach that can operate either with or without preconceived stratification of the cells into groups or along a continuum. We demonstrate the utility of Vision in several case studies and show that it can derive important sources of cellular variation and link them to experimental meta-data even with relatively homogeneous sets of cells.

Single-cell assays offer an opportunity to resolve cellular level heterogeneity, e.g., scRNA-seq enables single-cell expression profiling, and scATAC-seq identifies active regulatory elements. Furthermore, while scHi-C can measure the chromatin contacts (i.e., loops) between active regulatory elements to target genes in single cells, bulk HiChIP can measure such contacts in a higher resolution. In this work, we introduce DC3 (De-Convolution and Coupled-Clustering) as a method for the joint analysis of various bulk and single-cell data such as HiChIP, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq from the same heterogeneous cell population. DC3 can simultaneously identify distinct subpopulations, assign single cells to the subpopulations (i.e., clustering) and de-convolve the bulk data into subpopulation-specific data. The subpopulation-specific profiles of gene expression, chromatin accessibility and enhancer-promoter contact obtained by DC3 provide a comprehensive characterization of the gene regulatory system in each subpopulation.	717	1.9630390143737166	6	37	24	0.03347280334728033	14.25
10.1038/s41467-019-13099-0	FALSE	FALSE	A Bayesian mixture model for the analysis of allelic expression in single cells	2019-11-15	Allele-specific expression (ASE) at single-cell resolution is a critical tool for understanding the stochastic and dynamic features of gene expression. However, low read coverage and high biological variability present challenges for analyzing ASE. We demonstrate that discarding multi-mapping reads leads to higher variability in estimates of allelic proportions, an increased frequency of sampling zeros, and can lead to spurious findings of dynamic and monoallelic gene expression. Here, we report a method for ASE analysis from single-cell RNA-Seq data that accurately classifies allelic expression states and improves estimation of allelic proportions by pooling information across cells. We further demonstrate that combining information across cells using a hierarchical mixture model reduces sampling variability without sacrificing cell-to-cell heterogeneity. We applied our approach to re-evaluate the statistical independence of allelic bursting and track changes in the allele-specific expression patterns of cells sampled over a developmental time course.	681	1.864476386036961	3	32	7	0.010279001468428781	38.35

Although they are mainly used for quantifying expression levels, they contain much more biologically important information such as copy number variants (CNVs). Here, we present CaSpER, a signal processing approach for identification, visualization, and integrative analysis of focal and large-scale CNV events in multiscale resolution using either bulk or single-cell RNA sequencing data. CaSpER integrates the multiscale smoothing of expression signal and allelic shift signals for CNV calling. The allelic shift signal measures the loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) which is valuable for CNV identification. CaSpER employs an efficient methodology for the generation of a genome-wide B-allele frequency (BAF) signal profile from the reads and utilizes it for correction of CNVs calls. CaSpER increases the utility of RNA-sequencing datasets and complements other tools for complete characterization and visualization of the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of single cell and bulk RNA sequencing data.	632	1.730321697467488	3	53	23	0.03639240506329114	41.526

Augmenting few real observations with generated in silico samples could lead to more robust analysis results and a higher reproducibility rate. Here, we propose the use of conditional single-cell generative adversarial neural networks (cscGAN) for the realistic generation of single-cell RNA-seq data. cscGAN learns non-linear gene–gene dependencies from complex, multiple cell type samples and uses this information to generate realistic cells of defined types. Augmenting sparse cell populations with cscGAN generated cells improves downstream analyses such as the detection of marker genes, the robustness and reliability of classifiers, the assessment of novel analysis algorithms, and might reduce the number of animal experiments and costs in consequence. cscGAN outperforms existing methods for single-cell RNA-seq data generation in quality and hold great promise for the realistic generation and augmentation of other biomedical data types.	626	1.7138945927446954	7	48	34	0.054313099041533544	12.45

Advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing make it possible to infer latent developmental processes from the transcriptomic profiles of cells at various developmental stages. Accurate characterization is challenging however, particularly for periodic processes such as cell cycle. To address this, we develop Cyclum, an autoencoder approach identifying circular trajectories in the gene expression space. Cyclum substantially improves the accuracy and robustness of cell-cycle characterization beyond existing approaches. Applying Cyclum to removing cell-cycle effects substantially improves delineations of cell subpopulations, which is useful for establishing various cell atlases and studying tumor heterogeneity.	557	1.5249828884325805	4	47	6	0.010771992818671455	10.65

Here, we develop an integrative and scalable computational method, iDEA, to perform joint DE and GSE analysis through a hierarchical Bayesian framework. By integrating DE and GSE analyses, iDEA can improve the power and consistency of DE analysis and the accuracy of GSE analysis. Importantly, iDEA uses only DE summary statistics as input, enabling effective data modeling through complementing and pairing with various existing DE methods. We illustrate the benefits of iDEA with extensive simulations. We also apply iDEA to analyze three scRNA-seq data sets, where iDEA achieves up to five-fold power gain over existing GSE methods and up to 64% power gain over existing DE methods. The power gain brought by iDEA allows us to identify many pathways that would not be identified by existing approaches in these data.	548	1.5003422313483916	6	61	8	0.014598540145985401	5.75

We present SciBet, a supervised cell type identifier that accurately predicts cell identity for newly sequenced cells with order-of-magnitude speed advantage. We enable web client deployment of SciBet for rapid local computation without uploading local data to the server. Facing the exponential growth in the size of single cell RNA datasets, this user-friendly and cross-platform tool can be widely useful for single cell type identification.	530	1.4510609171800137	8	25	20	0.03773584905660377	3.1

Bisque implements a regression-based approach that utilizes single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) or single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data to generate a reference expression profile and learn gene-specific bulk expression transformations to robustly decompose RNA-seq data. These transformations significantly improve decomposition performance compared to existing methods when there is significant technical variation in the generation of the reference profile and observed bulk expression. Importantly, compared to existing methods, our approach is extremely efficient, making it suitable for the analysis of large genomic datasets that are becoming ubiquitous. When applied to subcutaneous adipose and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex expression datasets with both bulk RNA-seq and snRNA-seq data, Bisque replicates previously reported associations between cell type proportions and measured phenotypes across abundant and rare cell types. We further propose an additional mode of operation that merely requires a set of known marker genes.	520	1.4236824093086926	10	39	25	0.04807692307692308	34.78

We present DESC, an unsupervised deep embedding algorithm that clusters scRNA-seq data by iteratively optimizing a clustering objective function. Through iterative self-learning, DESC gradually removes batch effects, as long as technical differences across batches are smaller than true biological variations. As a soft clustering algorithm, cluster assignment probabilities from DESC are biologically interpretable and can reveal both discrete and pseudotemporal structure of cells. Comprehensive evaluations show that DESC offers a proper balance of clustering accuracy and stability, has a small footprint on memory, does not explicitly require batch information for batch effect removal, and can utilize GPU when available. As the scale of single-cell studies continues to grow, we believe DESC will offer a valuable tool for biomedical researchers to disentangle complex cellular heterogeneity.	503	1.377138945927447	10	25	37	0.073558648111332	28.85

We present SpaOTsc, a method relying on structured optimal transport to recover spatial properties of scRNA-seq data by utilizing spatial measurements of a relatively small number of genes. A spatial metric for individual cells in scRNA-seq data is first established based on a map connecting it with the spatial measurements. The cell–cell communications are then obtained by “optimally transporting” signal senders to target signal receivers in space. Using partial information decomposition, we next compute the intercellular gene–gene information flow to estimate the spatial regulations between genes across cells. Four datasets are employed for cross-validation of spatial gene expression prediction and comparison to known cell–cell communications. SpaOTsc has broader applications, both in integrating non-spatial single-cell measurements with spatial data, and directly in spatial single-cell transcriptomics data to reconstruct spatial cellular dynamics in tissues.	515	1.4099931553730323	2	63	33	0.06407766990291262	40.8

Often, it is not even clear whether a given cluster is uniform. Here we present an entropy-based statistic, ROGUE, to accurately quantify the purity of identified cell clusters. We demonstrate that our ROGUE metric is broadly applicable, and enables accurate, sensitive and robust assessment of cluster purity on a wide range of simulated and real datasets. Applying this metric to fibroblast, B cell and brain data, we identify additional subtypes and demonstrate the application of ROGUE-guided analyses to detect precise signals in specific subpopulations. ROGUE can be applied to all tested scRNA-seq datasets, and has important implications for evaluating the quality of putative clusters, discovering pure cell subtypes and constructing comprehensive, detailed and standardized single cell atlas.	461	1.2621492128678986	6	56	15	0.03253796095444685	12.6

With the rapid accumulation of public scRNA-seq data, an effective and efficient cell-querying method is critical for the utilization of the existing annotations to curate newly sequenced cells. Such a querying method should be based on an accurate cell-to-cell similarity measure, and capable of handling batch effects properly. Herein, we present Cell BLAST, an accurate and robust cell-querying method built on a neural network-based generative model and a customized cell-to-cell similarity metric. Through extensive benchmarks and case studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Cell BLAST in annotating discrete cell types and continuous cell differentiation potential, as well as identifying novel cell types. Powered by a well-curated reference database and a user-friendly Web server, Cell BLAST provides the one-stop solution for real-world scRNA-seq cell querying and annotation.	443	1.212867898699521	5	68	26	0.05869074492099323	7.55

However, those approaches only allow analysis of one extremity of the transcript after short read sequencing. In consequence, information on splicing and sequence heterogeneity is lost. To overcome this limitation, several approaches that use long-read sequencing were introduced recently. Yet, those techniques are limited by low sequencing depth and/or lacking or inaccurate assignment of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), which are critical for elimination of PCR bias and artifacts. We introduce ScNaUmi-seq, an approach that combines the high throughput of Oxford Nanopore sequencing with an accurate cell barcode and UMI assignment strategy. UMI guided error correction allows to generate high accuracy full length sequence information with the 10x Genomics single cell isolation system at high sequencing depths. We analyzed transcript isoform diversity in embryonic mouse brain and show that ScNaUmi-seq allows defining splicing and SNVs (RNA editing) at a single cell level.	410	1.1225188227241616	4	16	31	0.07560975609756097	57.13

How cell clusters are defined has important consequences for downstream analyses and the interpretation of results, but is often not straightforward. To address this difficulty, we present singleCellHaystack, a method that enables the prediction of DEGs without relying on explicit clustering of cells. Our method uses Kullback–Leibler divergence to find genes that are expressed in subsets of cells that are non-randomly positioned in a multidimensional space. Comparisons with existing DEG prediction approaches on artificial datasets show that singleCellHaystack has higher accuracy. We illustrate the usage of singleCellHaystack through applications on 136 real transcriptome datasets and a spatial transcriptomics dataset. We demonstrate that our method is a fast and accurate approach for DEG prediction in single-cell data. singleCellHaystack is implemented as an R package and is available from CRAN and GitHub.	394	1.0787132101300478	2	29	7	0.017766497461928935	66.13

Although many methods and approaches exist, identifying cell states and their underlying topology is still a major challenge. Here, we introduce the concept of multiresolution cell-state decomposition as a practical approach to simultaneously capture both fine- and coarse-grain patterns of variability. We implement this concept in ACTIONet, a comprehensive framework that combines archetypal analysis and manifold learning to provide a ready-to-use analytical approach for multiresolution single-cell state characterization. ACTIONet provides a robust, reproducible, and highly interpretable single-cell analysis platform that couples dominant pattern discovery with a corresponding structural representation of the cell state landscape. Using multiple synthetic and real data sets, we demonstrate ACTIONet’s superior performance relative to existing alternatives. We use ACTIONet to integrate and annotate cells across three human cortex data sets. Through integrative comparative analysis, we define a consensus vocabulary and a consistent set of gene signatures discriminating against the transcriptomic cell types and subtypes of the human prefrontal cortex.	335	0.917180013689254	3	46	7	0.020895522388059702	33.896

To study how these different cell types work together, here we develop NATMI (Network Analysis Toolkit for Multicellular Interactions). NATMI uses connectomeDB2020 (a database of 2293 manually curated ligand-receptor pairs with literature support) to predict and visualise cell-to-cell communication networks from single-cell (or bulk) expression data. Using multiple published single-cell datasets we demonstrate how NATMI can be used to identify (i) the cell-type pairs that are communicating the most (or most specifically) within a network, (ii) the most active (or specific) ligand-receptor pairs active within a network, (iii) putative highly-communicating cellular communities and (iv) differences in intercellular communication when profiling given cell types under different conditions. Furthermore, analysis of the Tabula Muris (organism-wide) atlas confirms our previous prediction that autocrine signalling is a major feature of cell-to-cell communication networks, while also revealing that hundreds of ligands and their cognate receptors are co-expressed in individual cells suggesting a substantial potential for self-signalling.	355	0.971937029431896	5	67	12	0.03380281690140845	46.7

For computational efficiency and easy visualization, dimensionality reduction is necessary to capture gene expression patterns in low-dimensional space. Here we propose an ensemble method for simultaneous dimensionality reduction and feature gene extraction (EDGE) of scRNA-seq data. Different from existing dimensionality reduction techniques, the proposed method implements an ensemble learning scheme that utilizes massive weak learners for an accurate similarity search. Based on the similarity matrix constructed by those weak learners, the low-dimensional embedding of the data is estimated and optimized through spectral embedding and stochastic gradient descent. Comprehensive simulation and empirical studies show that EDGE is well suited for searching for meaningful organization of cells, detecting rare cell types, and identifying essential feature genes associated with certain cell types.	313	0.8569472963723477	3	44	2	0.006389776357827476	12.196

Early analyses of differential expression have aimed at identifying differences between subpopulations to identify subpopulation markers. More generally, such methods compare expression levels across sets of cells, thus leading to cross-condition analyses. Given the emergence of replicated multi-condition scRNA-seq datasets, an area of increasing focus is making sample-level inferences, termed here as differential state analysis; however, it is not clear which statistical framework best handles this situation. Here, we surveyed methods to perform cross-condition differential state analyses, including cell-level mixed models and methods based on aggregated pseudobulk data. To evaluate method performance, we developed a flexible simulation that mimics multi-sample scRNA-seq data. We analyzed scRNA-seq data from mouse cortex cells to uncover subpopulation-specific responses to lipopolysaccharide treatment, and provide robust tools for multi-condition analysis within the muscat R package.	300	0.8213552361396304	8	71	29	0.09666666666666666	47.65

We present a single-cell investigation of differential isoform expression (DIE) between brain regions using single-cell long-read sequencing in mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in 45 cell types at postnatal day 7 (www.isoformAtlas.com). Isoform tests for DIE show better performance than exon tests. We detect hundreds of DIE events traceable to cell types, often corresponding to functionally distinct protein isoforms. Mostly, one cell type is responsible for brain-region specific DIE. However, for fewer genes, multiple cell types influence DIE. Thus, regional identity can, although rarely, override cell-type specificity. Cell types indigenous to one anatomic structure display distinctive DIE, e.g. the choroid plexus epithelium manifests distinct transcription-start-site usage. Spatial transcriptomics and long-read sequencing yield a spatially resolved splicing map. Our methods quantify isoform expression with cell-type and spatial resolution and it contributes to further our understanding of how the brain integrates molecular and cellular complexity.	250	0.6844626967830253	30	93	6	0.024	75

However, important challenges remain: global integration of cell-to-cell communication; biological interpretation; and application to individual cell population transcriptomic profiles. We develop ICELLNET, a transcriptomic-based framework integrating: 1) an original expert-curated database of ligand–receptor interactions accounting for multiple subunits expression; 2) quantification of communication scores; 3) the possibility to connect a cell population of interest with 31 reference human cell types; and 4) three visualization modes to facilitate biological interpretation. We apply ICELLNET to three datasets generated through RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, and microarray. ICELLNET reveals autocrine IL-10 control of human dendritic cell communication with up to 12 cell types. Four of them (T cells, keratinocytes, neutrophils, pDC) are further tested and experimentally validated. In summary, ICELLNET is a global, versatile, biologically validated, and easy-to-use framework to dissect cell communication from individual or multiple cell-based transcriptomic profiles.	221	0.6050650239561944	9	53	11	0.049773755656108594	5.4

Through manifold learning and quantitative contrasts, CellChat classifies signaling pathways and delineates conserved and context-specific pathways across different datasets. Applying CellChat to mouse and human skin datasets shows its ability to extract complex signaling patterns.

To address this challenge, we introduce an analysis framework, named single-cell Decomposition using Hierarchical Autoencoder (scDHA), that reliably extracts representative information of each cell. The scDHA pipeline consists of two core modules. The first module is a non-negative kernel autoencoder able to remove genes or components that have insignificant contributions to the part-based representation of the data. The second module is a stacked Bayesian autoencoder that projects the data onto a low-dimensional space (compressed). To diminish the tendency to overfit of neural networks, we repeatedly perturb the compressed space to learn a more generalized representation of the data. In an extensive analysis, we demonstrate that scDHA outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in many research sub-fields of scRNA-seq analysis, including cell segregation through unsupervised learning, visualization of transcriptome landscape, cell classification, and pseudo-time inference.	223	0.6105407255304586	6	77	5	0.02242152466367713	19.796

Multi-omic data for single cell gene expression, in situ hybridization, or single cell chromatin states are increasingly available across diverse tissue types. When isolating specific cell types from a sample of disassociated cells or performing in situ sequencing in collections of heterogeneous cells, one challenging task is to select a small set of informative markers that robustly enable the identification and discrimination of specific cell types or cell states as precisely as possible. Given single cell RNA-seq data and a set of cellular labels to discriminate, scGeneFit selects gene markers that jointly optimize cell label recovery using label-aware compressive classification methods. This results in a substantially more robust and less redundant set of markers than existing methods, most of which identify markers that separate each cell label from the rest. When applied to a data set given a hierarchy of cell types as labels, the markers found by our method improves the recovery of the cell type hierarchy with fewer markers than existing methods using a computationally efficient and principled optimization.	219	0.5995893223819302	4	19	2	0.0091324200913242	68.1

Single-cell sequencing technologies are powerful tools to explore cells, however analysis is typically gene-centric and TE expression has not been addressed. Here, we develop a single-cell TE processing pipeline, scTE, and report the expression of TEs in single cells in a range of biological contexts. Specific TE types are expressed in subpopulations of embryonic stem cells and are dynamically regulated during pluripotency reprogramming, differentiation, and embryogenesis. Unexpectedly, TEs are expressed in somatic cells, including human disease-specific TEs that are undetectable in bulk analyses. Finally, we apply scTE to single-cell ATAC-seq data, and demonstrate that scTE can discriminate cell type using chromatin accessibly of TEs alone. Overall, our results classify the dynamic patterns of TEs in single cells and their contributions to cell heterogeneity.	205	0.5612594113620808	12	94	6	0.02926829268292683	45.8
10.1038/s41467-021-22008-3	FALSE	FALSE	Model-based deep embedding for constrained clustering analysis of single cell RNA-seq data	2021-03-25	Clustering is a critical step in single cell-based studies. Most existing methods support unsupervised clustering without the a priori exploitation of any domain knowledge. When confronted by the high dimensionality and pervasive dropout events of scRNA-Seq data, purely unsupervised clustering methods may not produce biologically interpretable clusters, which complicates cell type assignment. In such cases, the only recourse is for the user to manually and repeatedly tweak clustering parameters until acceptable clusters are found. Consequently, the path to obtaining biologically meaningful clusters can be ad hoc and laborious. Here we report a principled clustering method named scDCC, that integrates domain knowledge into the clustering step. Experiments on various scRNA-seq datasets from thousands to tens of thousands of cells show that scDCC can significantly improve clustering performance, facilitating the interpretability of clusters and downstream analyses, such as cell type assignment.	185	0.5065023956194388	5	67	2	0.010810810810810811	16.346
10.1038/s41467-021-22197-x	FALSE	FALSE	scGNN is a novel graph neural network framework for single-cell RNA-Seq analyses	2021-03-25	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) is widely used to reveal the heterogeneity and dynamics of tissues, organisms, and complex diseases, but its analyses still suffer from multiple grand challenges, including the sequencing sparsity and complex differential patterns in gene expression. We introduce the scGNN (single-cell graph neural network) to provide a hypothesis-free deep learning framework for scRNA-Seq analyses. This framework formulates and aggregates cell–cell relationships with graph neural networks and models heterogeneous gene expression patterns using a left-truncated mixture Gaussian model. scGNN integrates three iterative multi-modal autoencoders and outperforms existing tools for gene imputation and cell clustering on four benchmark scRNA-Seq datasets. In an Alzheimer’s disease study with 13,214 single nuclei from postmortem brain tissues, scGNN successfully illustrated disease-related neural development and the differential mechanism. scGNN provides an effective representation of gene expression and cell–cell relationships. It is also a powerful framework that can be applied to general scRNA-Seq analyses.	185	0.5065023956194388	10	63	8	0.043243243243243246	97.546

Yet, as we show here with scRNA-seq experiments and analyses spanning human, mouse, chicken, mole rat, lemur and sea urchin, genome annotations are often incomplete, in particular for organisms that are not routinely studied. To overcome this hurdle, we created a scRNA-seq analysis routine that recovers biologically relevant transcriptional activity beyond the scope of the best available genome annotation by performing scRNA-seq analysis on any region in the genome for which transcriptional products are detected. Our tool generates a single-cell expression matrix for all transcriptionally active regions (TARs), performs single-cell TAR expression analysis to identify biologically significant TARs, and then annotates TARs using gene homology analysis. This procedure uses single-cell expression analyses as a filter to direct annotation efforts to biologically significant transcripts and thereby uncovers biology to which scRNA-seq would otherwise be in the dark.	167	0.45722108145106094	8	48	0	0	49.996

Dimensionality reduction is a crucial step in interpreting the relation between cells in scRNA-seq data. However, current dimensionality reduction methods are often confounded by multiple simultaneous technical and biological variability, result in “crowding” of cells in the center of the latent space, or inadequately capture temporal relationships. Here, we introduce scPhere, a scalable deep generative model to embed cells into low-dimensional hyperspherical or hyperbolic spaces to accurately represent scRNA-seq data. ScPhere addresses multi-level, complex batch factors, facilitates the interactive visualization of large datasets, resolves cell crowding, and uncovers temporal trajectories. We demonstrate scPhere on nine large datasets in complex tissue from human patients or animal development. Our results show how scPhere facilitates the interpretation of scRNA-seq data by generating batch-invariant embeddings to map data from new individuals, identifies cell types affected by biological variables, infers cells’ spatial positions in pre-defined biological specimens, and highlights complex cellular relations.	144	0.3942505133470226	2	87	5	0.034722222222222224	97.83
10.1038/s41467-021-23196-8	FALSE	FALSE	Hierarchical progressive learning of cell identities in single-cell data	2021-05-14	Supervised methods are increasingly used to identify cell populations in single-cell data. Yet, current methods are limited in their ability to learn from multiple datasets simultaneously, are hampered by the annotation of datasets at different resolutions, and do not preserve annotations when retrained on new datasets. The latter point is especially important as researchers cannot rely on downstream analysis performed using earlier versions of the dataset. Here, we present scHPL, a hierarchical progressive learning method which allows continuous learning from single-cell data by leveraging the different resolutions of annotations across multiple datasets to learn and continuously update a classification tree. We evaluate the classification and tree learning performance using simulated as well as real datasets and show that scHPL can successfully learn known cellular hierarchies from multiple datasets while preserving the original annotations. scHPL is available at https://github.com/lcmmichielsen/scHPL.	135	0.36960985626283366	3	43	0	0	31.08

However, consistent definition of cell subtypes and cell states across studies and diseases remains a major challenge. Here we generate reference T cell atlases for cancer and viral infection by multi-study integration, and develop ProjecTILs, an algorithm for reference atlas projection. In contrast to other methods, ProjecTILs allows not only accurate embedding of new scRNA-seq data into a reference without altering its structure, but also characterizing previously unknown cell states that “deviate” from the reference. ProjecTILs accurately predicts the effects of cell perturbations and identifies gene programs that are altered in different conditions and tissues. A meta-analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells from several cohorts reveals a strong conservation of T cell subtypes between human and mouse, providing a consistent basis to describe T cell heterogeneity across studies, diseases, and species.	129	0.3531827515400411	6	74	5	0.03875968992248062	89.05

We introduce PRESCIENT (Potential eneRgy undErlying Single Cell gradIENTs), a generative modeling framework that learns an underlying differentiation landscape from time-series scRNA-seq data. We validate PRESCIENT on an experimental lineage tracing dataset, where we show that PRESCIENT is able to predict the fate biases of progenitor cells in hematopoiesis when accounting for cell proliferation, improving upon the best-performing existing method. We demonstrate how PRESCIENT can simulate trajectories for perturbed cells, recovering the expected effects of known modulators of cell fate in hematopoiesis and pancreatic β cell differentiation. PRESCIENT is able to accommodate complex perturbations of multiple genes, at different time points and from different starting cell populations, and is available at https://github.com/gifford-lab/prescient.	121	0.33127994524298426	3	53	0	0	9.08

We demonstrate its potential for spearheading computational methods on three applications: aligning cell developmental trajectories, cell-specific regulatory network inference and estimation of RNA velocity.	94	0.25735797399041754	4	59	0	0	47.75

Large-scale single cell transcriptomics provide both opportunities and challenges for identifying rare cells playing crucial roles in development and disease. Here, we develop GapClust, a light-weight algorithm to detect rare cell types from ultra-large scRNA-seq datasets with state-of-the-art speed and memory efficiency. Benchmarking on diverse experimental datasets demonstrates the superior performance of GapClust compared to other recently proposed methods. When applying our algorithm to an intestine and 68 k PBMC datasets, GapClust identifies the tuft cells and a previously unrecognised subtype of monocyte, respectively.	81	0.22176591375770022	8	47	0	0	8.846
10.1038/s41467-021-25089-2	FALSE	FALSE	Sc-compReg enables the comparison of gene regulatory networks between conditions using single-cell data	2021-08-06	The comparison of gene regulatory networks between diseased versus healthy individuals or between two different treatments is an important scientific problem. Here, we propose sc-compReg as a method for the comparative analysis of gene expression regulatory networks between two conditions using single cell gene expression (scRNA-seq) and single cell chromatin accessibility data (scATAC-seq). Our software, sc-compReg, can be used as a stand-alone package that provides joint clustering and embedding of the cells from both scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq, and the construction of differential regulatory networks across two conditions. We apply the method to compare the gene regulatory networks of an individual with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) versus a healthy control. The analysis reveals a tumor-specific B cell subpopulation in the CLL patient and identifies TOX2 as a potential regulator of this subpopulation.	51	0.13963039014373715	10	33	0	0	6.35
10.1038/s41467-021-25534-2	FALSE	FALSE	Learning interpretable cellular and gene signature embeddings from single-cell transcriptomic data	2021-09-06	The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has revolutionized transcriptomic studies. However, large-scale integrative analysis of scRNA-seq data remains a challenge largely due to unwanted batch effects and the limited transferabilty, interpretability, and scalability of the existing computational methods. We present single-cell Embedded Topic Model (scETM). Our key contribution is the utilization of a transferable neural-network-based encoder while having an interpretable linear decoder via a matrix tri-factorization. In particular, scETM simultaneously learns an encoder network to infer cell type mixture and a set of highly interpretable gene embeddings, topic embeddings, and batch-effect linear intercepts from multiple scRNA-seq datasets. scETM is scalable to over 106 cells and confers remarkable cross-tissue and cross-species zero-shot transfer-learning performance. Using gene set enrichment analysis, we find that scETM-learned topics are enriched in biologically meaningful and disease-related pathways. Lastly, scETM enables the incorporation of known gene sets into the gene embeddings, thereby directly learning the associations between pathways and topics via the topic embeddings.	20	0.05475701574264202	5	78	1	0.05	15.8
10.1038/s41467-021-25548-w	FALSE	FALSE	Dissecting transition cells from single-cell transcriptome data through multiscale stochastic dynamics	2021-09-23	Advances in single-cell technologies allow scrutinizing of heterogeneous cell states, however, detecting cell-state transitions from snap-shot single-cell transcriptome data remains challenging. To investigate cells with transient properties or mixed identities, we present MuTrans, a method based on multiscale reduction technique to identify the underlying stochastic dynamics that prescribes cell-fate transitions. By iteratively unifying transition dynamics across multiple scales, MuTrans constructs the cell-fate dynamical manifold that depicts progression of cell-state transitions, and distinguishes stable and transition cells. In addition, MuTrans quantifies the likelihood of all possible transition trajectories between cell states using coarse-grained transition path theory. Downstream analysis identifies distinct genes that mark the transient states or drive the transitions. The method is consistent with the well-established Langevin equation and transition rate theory. Applying MuTrans to datasets collected from five different single-cell experimental platforms, we show its capability and scalability to robustly unravel complex cell fate dynamics induced by transition cells in systems such as tumor EMT, iPSC differentiation and blood cell differentiation. Overall, our method bridges data-driven and model-based approaches on cell-fate transitions at single-cell resolution.	3	0.008213552361396304	4	63	0	0	2.75
10.1038/s41467-021-25725-x	FALSE	FALSE	Leveraging the Cell Ontology to classify unseen cell types	2021-09-21	Single cell technologies are rapidly generating large amounts of data that enables us to understand biological systems at single-cell resolution. However, joint analysis of datasets generated by independent labs remains challenging due to a lack of consistent terminology to describe cell types. Here, we present OnClass, an algorithm and accompanying software for automatically classifying cells into cell types that are part of the controlled vocabulary that forms the Cell Ontology. A key advantage of OnClass is its capability to classify cells into cell types not present in the training data because it uses the Cell Ontology graph to infer cell type relationships. Furthermore, OnClass can be used to identify marker genes for all the cell ontology categories, regardless of whether the cell types are present or absent in the training data, suggesting that OnClass goes beyond a simple annotation tool for single cell datasets, being the first algorithm capable to identify marker genes specific to all terms of the Cell Ontology and offering the possibility of refining the Cell Ontology using a data-centric approach.	5	0.013689253935660506	9	58	0	0	4.85
10.1038/s41467-021-25773-3	FALSE	FALSE	Generalized and scalable trajectory inference in single-cell omics data with VIA	2021-09-20	Inferring cellular trajectories using a variety of omic data is a critical task in single-cell data science. However, accurate prediction of cell fates, and thereby biologically meaningful discovery, is challenged by the sheer size of single-cell data, the diversity of omic data types, and the complexity of their topologies. We present VIA, a scalable trajectory inference algorithm that overcomes these limitations by using lazy-teleporting random walks to accurately reconstruct complex cellular trajectories beyond tree-like pathways (e.g., cyclic or disconnected structures). We show that VIA robustly and efficiently unravels the fine-grained sub-trajectories in a 1.3-million-cell transcriptomic mouse atlas without losing the global connectivity at such a high cell count. We further apply VIA to discovering elusive lineages and less populous cell fates missed by other methods across a variety of data types, including single-cell proteomic, epigenomic, multi-omics datasets, and a new in-house single-cell morphological dataset.	6	0.01642710472279261	5	67	0	0	13.6
10.1038/s41540-020-00162-6	FALSE	FALSE	Sparsely-connected autoencoder (SCA) for single cell RNAseq data mining	2021-01-05	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) is an essential tool to investigate cellular heterogeneity. Thus, it would be of great interest being able to disclose biological information belonging to cell subpopulations, which can be defined by clustering analysis of scRNAseq data. In this manuscript, we report a tool that we developed for the functional mining of single cell clusters based on Sparsely-Connected Autoencoder (SCA). This tool allows uncovering hidden features associated with scRNAseq data. We implemented two new metrics, QCC (Quality Control of Cluster) and QCM (Quality Control of Model), which allow quantifying the ability of SCA to reconstruct valuable cell clusters and to evaluate the quality of the neural network achievements, respectively. Our data indicate that SCA encoded space, derived by different experimentally validated data (TF targets, miRNA targets, Kinase targets, and cancer-related immune signatures), can be used to grasp single cell cluster-specific functional features. In our implementation, SCA efficacy comes from its ability to reconstruct only specific clusters, thus indicating only those clusters where the SCA encoding space is a key element for cells aggregation. SCA analysis is implemented as module in rCASC framework and it is supported by a GUI to simplify it usage for biologists and medical personnel.	264	0.7227926078028748	9	45	2	0.007575757575757576	1

Yet learning from reference data is complicated by batch effects between datasets, limited availability of computational resources and sharing restrictions on raw data. Here we introduce a deep learning strategy for mapping query datasets on top of a reference called single-cell architectural surgery (scArches). scArches uses transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient, decentralized, iterative reference building and contextualization of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data. Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, immune and whole-organism atlases, we show that scArches preserves biological state information while removing batch effects, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters than de novo integration. scArches generalizes to multimodal reference mapping, allowing imputation of missing modalities. Finally, scArches retains coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease variation when mapping to a healthy reference, enabling the discovery of disease-specific cell states. scArches will facilitate collaborative projects by enabling iterative construction, updating, sharing and efficient use of reference atlases.	27	0.07392197125256673	13	84	0	0	304.676

We performed single-cell transcriptome, surface proteome and T and B lymphocyte antigen receptor analyses of over 780,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a cross-sectional cohort of 130 patients with varying severities of COVID-19. We identified expansion of nonclassical monocytes expressing complement transcripts (CD16+C1QA/B/C+) that sequester platelets and were predicted to replenish the alveolar macrophage pool in COVID-19. Early, uncommitted CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells were primed toward megakaryopoiesis, accompanied by expanded megakaryocyte-committed progenitors and increased platelet activation. Clonally expanded CD8+ T cells and an increased ratio of CD8+ effector T cells to effector memory T cells characterized severe disease, while circulating follicular helper T cells accompanied mild disease. We observed a relative loss of IgA2 in symptomatic disease despite an overall expansion of plasmablasts and plasma cells.

10.1038/s41598-019-56911-z	FALSE	FALSE	Using transfer learning from prior reference knowledge to improve the clustering of single-cell RNA-Seq data	2019-12-30	In many research areas scientists are interested in clustering objects within small datasets while making use of prior knowledge from large reference datasets. We propose a method to apply the machine learning concept of transfer learning to unsupervised clustering problems and show its effectiveness in the field of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq). The goal of scRNA-Seq experiments is often the definition and cataloguing of cell types from the transcriptional output of individual cells. To improve the clustering of small disease- or tissue-specific datasets, for which the identification of rare cell types is often problematic, we propose a transfer learning method to utilize large and well-annotated reference datasets, such as those produced by the Human Cell Atlas. Our approach modifies the dataset of interest while incorporating key information from the larger reference dataset via Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). The modified dataset is subsequently provided to a clustering algorithm. We empirically evaluate the benefits of our approach on simulated scRNA-Seq data as well as on publicly available datasets. Finally, we present results for the analysis of a recently published small dataset and find improved clustering when transferring knowledge from a large reference dataset. Implementations of the method are available at https://github.com/nicococo/scRNA.	636	1.7412731006160165	7	81	8	0.012578616352201259	8.95
10.1038/s41598-020-60400-z	FALSE	FALSE	Reconstructing temporal and spatial dynamics from single-cell pseudotime using prior knowledge of real scale cell densities	2020-02-27	Modern cytometry methods allow collecting complex, multi-dimensional data sets from heterogeneous cell populations at single-cell resolution. While methods exist to describe the progression and order of cellular processes from snapshots of such populations, these descriptions are limited to arbitrary pseudotime scales. Here we describe MAPiT, an universal transformation method that recovers real-time dynamics of cellular processes from pseudotime scales by utilising knowledge of the distributions on the real scales. As use cases, we applied MAPiT to two prominent problems in the flow-cytometric analysis of heterogeneous cell populations: (1) recovering the kinetics of cell cycle progression in unsynchronised and thus unperturbed cell populations, and (2) recovering the spatial arrangement of cells within multi-cellular spheroids prior to spheroid dissociation for cytometric analysis. Since MAPiT provides a theoretic basis for the relation of pseudotime values to real temporal and spatial scales, it can be used broadly in the analysis of cellular processes with snapshot data from heterogeneous cell populations.	577	1.5797399041752225	6	30	2	0.0034662045060658577	NA

Published algorithms for automatic cell annotation are limited to known cell types and fail to capture novel populations, especially cancer cells. We developed northstar, a computational approach to classify thousands of cells based on published data within seconds while simultaneously identifying and highlighting new cell states such as malignancies. We tested northstar on data from glioblastoma, melanoma, and seven different healthy tissues and obtained high accuracy and robustness. We collected eleven pancreatic tumors and identified three shared and five private neoplastic cell populations, offering insight into the origins of neuroendocrine and exocrine tumors. Northstar is a useful tool to assign known and novel cell type and states in the age of cell atlases.	374	1.0239561943874058	8	38	2	0.0053475935828877	13.68
10.1038/s41598-021-88875-4	FALSE	FALSE	Synthetic single cell RNA sequencing data from small pilot studies using deep generative models	2021-04-30	Deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) or deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs), can generate an arbitrary number of synthetic observations after being trained on an initial set of samples. This has mainly been investigated for imaging data but could also be useful for single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq). A small pilot study could be used for planning a full-scale experiment by investigating planned analysis strategies on synthetic data with different sample sizes. It is unclear whether synthetic observations generated based on a small scRNA-seq dataset reflect the properties relevant for subsequent data analysis steps. We specifically investigated two deep generative modeling approaches, VAEs and DBMs. First, we considered single-cell variational inference (scVI) in two variants, generating samples from the posterior distribution, the standard approach, or the prior distribution. Second, we propose single-cell deep Boltzmann machines (scDBMs). When considering the similarity of clustering results on synthetic data to ground-truth clustering, we find that the $$scVI_{posterior}$$ s c V I posterior variant resulted in high variability, most likely due to amplifying artifacts of small datasets. All approaches showed mixed results for cell types with different abundance by overrepresenting highly abundant cell types and missing less abundant cell types. With increasing pilot dataset sizes, the proportions of the cells in each cluster became more similar to that of ground-truth data. We also showed that all approaches learn the univariate distribution of most genes, but problems occurred with bimodality. Across all analyses, in comparing 10$$\times$$ × Genomics and Smart-seq2 technologies, we could show that for 10$$\times$$ × datasets, which have higher sparsity, it is more challenging to make inference from small to larger datasets. Overall, the results show that generative deep learning approaches might be valuable for supporting the design of scRNA-seq experiments.	149	0.4079397672826831	6	54	0	0	5.1
10.1038/s42003-021-02146-6	FALSE	FALSE	NEBULA is a fast negative binomial mixed model for differential or co-expression analysis of large-scale multi-subject single-cell data	2021-05-26	The increasing availability of single-cell data revolutionizes the understanding of biological mechanisms at cellular resolution. For differential expression analysis in multi-subject single-cell data, negative binomial mixed models account for both subject-level and cell-level overdispersions, but are computationally demanding. Here, we propose an efficient NEgative Binomial mixed model Using a Large-sample Approximation (NEBULA). The speed gain is achieved by analytically solving high-dimensional integrals instead of using the Laplace approximation. We demonstrate that NEBULA is orders of magnitude faster than existing tools and controls false-positive errors in marker gene identification and co-expression analysis. Using NEBULA in Alzheimer’s disease cohort data sets, we found that the cell-level expression of APOE correlated with that of other genetic risk factors (including CLU, CST3, TREM2, C1q, and ITM2B) in a cell-type-specific pattern and an isoform-dependent manner in microglia. NEBULA opens up a new avenue for the broad application of mixed models to large-scale multi-subject single-cell data.	123	0.33675564681724846	6	80	0	0	2

Because these methods destroy cells in the process of analysis, they cannot measure how gene expression changes over time. However, some information on dynamics is present in the data: the continuum of molecular states in the population can reflect the trajectory of a typical cell. Many methods for extracting single-cell dynamics from population data have been proposed. However, all such attempts face a common limitation: for any measured distribution of cell states, there are multiple dynamics that could give rise to it, and by extension, multiple possibilities for underlying mechanisms of gene regulation. Here, we describe the aspects of gene expression dynamics that cannot be inferred from a static snapshot alone and identify assumptions necessary to constrain a unique solution for cell dynamics from static snapshots. We translate these constraints into a practical algorithmic approach, population balance analysis (PBA), which makes use of a method from spectral graph theory to solve a class of high-dimensional differential equations. We use simulations to show the strengths and limitations of PBA, and then apply it to single-cell profiles of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Cell state predictions from this analysis agree with HPC fate assays reported in several papers over the past two decades. By highlighting the fundamental limits on dynamic inference faced by any method, our framework provides a rigorous basis for dynamic interpretation of a gene expression continuum and clarifies best experimental designs for trajectory reconstruction from static snapshot measurements.	1314	3.597535934291581	5	44	125	0.09512937595129375	4.25
10.1073/pnas.1721085115	FALSE	FALSE	Gene expression distribution deconvolution in single-cell RNA sequencing	2018-06-26	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the quantification of each gene’s expression distribution across cells, thus allowing the assessment of the dispersion, nonzero fraction, and other aspects of its distribution beyond the mean. These statistical characterizations of the gene expression distribution are critical for understanding expression variation and for selecting marker genes for population heterogeneity. However, scRNA-seq data are noisy, with each cell typically sequenced at low coverage, thus making it difficult to infer properties of the gene expression distribution from raw counts. Based on a reexamination of nine public datasets, we propose a simple technical noise model for scRNA-seq data with unique molecular identifiers (UMI). We develop deconvolution of single-cell expression distribution (DESCEND), a method that deconvolves the true cross-cell gene expression distribution from observed scRNA-seq counts, leading to improved estimates of properties of the distribution such as dispersion and nonzero fraction. DESCEND can adjust for cell-level covariates such as cell size, cell cycle, and batch effects. DESCEND’s noise model and estimation accuracy are further evaluated through comparisons to RNA FISH data, through data splitting and simulations and through its effectiveness in removing known batch effects. We demonstrate how DESCEND can clarify and improve downstream analyses such as finding differentially expressed genes, identifying cell types, and selecting differentiation markers.	1188	3.252566735112936	9	47	56	0.04713804713804714	21.396
10.1073/pnas.1817715116	FALSE	FALSE	Semisoft clustering of single-cell data	2018-12-26	Motivated by the dynamics of development, in which cells of recognizable types, or pure cell types, transition into other types over time, we propose a method of semisoft clustering that can classify both pure and intermediate cell types from data on gene expression from individual cells. Called semisoft clustering with pure cells (SOUP), this algorithm reveals the clustering structure for both pure cells and transitional cells with soft memberships. SOUP involves a two-step process: Identify the set of pure cells and then estimate a membership matrix. To find pure cells, SOUP uses the special block structure in the expression similarity matrix. Once pure cells are identified, they provide the key information from which the membership matrix can be computed. By modeling cells as a continuous mixture of K discrete types we obtain more parsimonious results than obtained with standard clustering algorithms. Moreover, using soft membership estimates of cell type cluster centers leads to better estimates of developmental trajectories. The strong performance of SOUP is documented via simulation studies, which show its robustness to violations of modeling assumptions. The advantages of SOUP are illustrated by analyses of two independent datasets of gene expression from a large number of cells from fetal brain.	1005	2.751540041067762	5	36	38	0.03781094527363184	4.25

Here we present scMerge, an algorithm that integrates multiple single-cell RNA-seq datasets using factor analysis of stably expressed genes and pseudoreplicates across datasets. Using a large collection of public datasets, we benchmark scMerge against published methods and demonstrate that it consistently provides improved cell type separation by removing unwanted factors; scMerge can also enhance biological discovery through robust data integration, which we show through the inference of development trajectory in a liver dataset collection.	884	2.4202600958247777	11	56	61	0.06900452488687783	24.5

Examples include correlation and mutual information methods for coexpression analysis, clustering and undirected graphical models for functional assignments, and directed graphical models for pathway reconstruction. Using an encoding for gene expression data, followed by deep neural networks analysis, we present a framework that can successfully address all of these diverse tasks. We show that our method, convolutional neural network for coexpression (CNNC), improves upon prior methods in tasks ranging from predicting transcription factor targets to identifying disease-related genes to causality inference. CNNC’s encoding provides insights about some of the decisions it makes and their biological basis. CNNC is flexible and can easily be extended to integrate additional types of genomics data, leading to further improvements in its performance.	656	1.7960301163586585	2	46	38	0.057926829268292686	52.18
10.1073/pnas.2005990117	FALSE	FALSE	Dissecting heterogeneous cell populations across drug and disease conditions with PopAlign	2020-10-30	Single-cell measurement techniques can now probe gene expression in heterogeneous cell populations from the human body across a range of environmental and physiological conditions. However, new mathematical and computational methods are required to represent and analyze gene-expression changes that occur in complex mixtures of single cells as they respond to signals, drugs, or disease states. Here, we introduce a mathematical modeling platform, PopAlign, that automatically identifies subpopulations of cells within a heterogeneous mixture and tracks gene-expression and cell-abundance changes across subpopulations by constructing and comparing probabilistic models. Probabilistic models provide a low-error, compressed representation of single-cell data that enables efficient large-scale computations. We apply PopAlign to analyze the impact of 40 different immunomodulatory compounds on a heterogeneous population of donor-derived human immune cells as well as patient-specific disease signatures in multiple myeloma. PopAlign scales to comparisons involving tens to hundreds of samples, enabling large-scale studies of natural and engineered cell populations as they respond to drugs, signals, or physiological change.	331	0.9062286105407256	8	48	4	0.012084592145015106	11.2
10.1073/pnas.2023070118	FALSE	FALSE	BABEL enables cross-modality translation between multiomic profiles at single-cell resolution	2021-04-07	Simultaneous profiling of multiomic modalities within a single cell is a grand challenge for single-cell biology. While there have been impressive technical innovations demonstrating feasibility—for example, generating paired measurements of single-cell transcriptome (single-cell RNA sequencing [scRNA-seq]) and chromatin accessibility (single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing [scATAC-seq])—widespread application of joint profiling is challenging due to its experimental complexity, noise, and cost. Here, we introduce BABEL, a deep learning method that translates between the transcriptome and chromatin profiles of a single cell. Leveraging an interoperable neural network model, BABEL can predict single-cell expression directly from a cell’s scATAC-seq and vice versa after training on relevant data. This makes it possible to computationally synthesize paired multiomic measurements when only one modality is experimentally available. Across several paired single-cell ATAC and gene expression datasets in human and mouse, we validate that BABEL accurately translates between these modalities for individual cells. BABEL also generalizes well to cell types within new biological contexts not seen during training. Starting from scATAC-seq of patient-derived basal cell carcinoma (BCC), BABEL generated single-cell expression that enabled fine-grained classification of complex cell states, despite having never seen BCC data. These predictions are comparable to analyses of experimental BCC scRNA-seq data for diverse cell types related to BABEL’s training data. We further show that BABEL can incorporate additional single-cell data modalities, such as protein epitope profiling, thus enabling translation across chromatin, RNA, and protein. BABEL offers a powerful approach for data exploration and hypothesis generation.	172	0.47091033538672145	4	60	5	0.029069767441860465	20.85
10.1073/pnas.2024383118	FALSE	FALSE	Integration and transfer learning of single-cell transcriptomes via cFIT	2021-03-03	Large, comprehensive collections of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets have been generated that allow for the full transcriptional characterization of cell types across a wide variety of biological and clinical conditions. As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these datasets or transfer knowledge from one to the other to better understand cellular identity and functions. Here, we present a simple yet surprisingly effective method named common factor integration and transfer learning (cFIT) for capturing various batch effects across experiments, technologies, subjects, and even species. The proposed method models the shared information between various datasets by a common factor space while allowing for unique distortions and shifts in genewise expression in each batch. The model parameters are learned under an iterative nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) framework and then used for synchronized integration from across-domain assays. In addition, the model enables transferring via low-rank matrix from more informative data to allow for precise identification in data of lower quality. Compared with existing approaches, our method imposes weaker assumptions on the cell composition of each individual dataset; however, it is shown to be more reliable in preserving biological variations. We apply cFIT to multiple scRNA-seq datasets of developing brain from human and mouse, varying by technologies and developmental stages. The successful integration and transfer uncover the transcriptional resemblance across systems. The study helps establish a comprehensive landscape of brain cell-type diversity and provides insights into brain development.	207	0.5667351129363449	5	34	3	0.014492753623188406	22.396

10.1093/bib/bbaa097	FALSE	FALSE	SMNN: batch effect correction for single-cell RNA-seq data via supervised mutual nearest neighbor detection	2020-06-26	Batch effect correction has been recognized to be indispensable when integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from multiple batches. State-of-the-art methods ignore single-cell cluster label information, but such information can improve the effectiveness of batch effect correction, particularly under realistic scenarios where biological differences are not orthogonal to batch effects. To address this issue, we propose SMNN for batch effect correction of scRNA-seq data via supervised mutual nearest neighbor detection. Our extensive evaluations in simulated and real datasets show that SMNN provides improved merging within the corresponding cell types across batches, leading to reduced differentiation across batches over MNN, Seurat v3 and LIGER. Furthermore, SMNN retains more cell-type-specific features, partially manifested by differentially expressed genes identified between cell types after SMNN correction being biologically more relevant, with precision improving by up to 841.0%.	457	1.2511978097193703	6	29	3	0.006564551422319475	17.45
10.1093/bib/bbaa127	FALSE	FALSE	scCancer: a package for automated processing of single-cell RNA-seq data in cancer	2020-07-06	Molecular heterogeneities and complex microenvironments bring great challenges for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology make it possible to study cancer cell heterogeneities and microenvironments at single-cell transcriptomic level. Here, we develop an R package named scCancer, which focuses on processing and analyzing scRNA-seq data for cancer research. Except basic data processing steps, this package takes several special considerations for cancer-specific features. Firstly, the package introduced comprehensive quality control metrics. Secondly, it used a data-driven machine learning algorithm to accurately identify major cancer microenvironment cell populations. Thirdly, it estimated a malignancy score to classify malignant (cancerous) and non-malignant cells. Then, it analyzed intra-tumor heterogeneities by key cellular phenotypes (such as cell cycle and stemness), gene signatures and cell–cell interactions. Besides, it provided multi-sample data integration analysis with different batch-effect correction strategies. Finally, user-friendly graphic reports were generated for all the analyses. By testing on 56 samples with 433 405 cells in total, we demonstrated its good performance.

10.1093/bib/bbaa216	FALSE	FALSE	A spectral clustering with self-weighted multiple kernel learning method for single-cell RNA-seq data	2020-10-01	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data widely exist in bioinformatics. It is crucial to devise a distance metric for scRNA-seq data. Almost all existing clustering methods based on spectral clustering algorithms work in three separate steps: similarity graph construction; continuous labels learning; discretization of the learned labels by k-means clustering. However, this common practice has potential flaws that may lead to severe information loss and degradation of performance. Furthermore, the performance of a kernel method is largely determined by the selected kernel; a self-weighted multiple kernel learning model can help choose the most suitable kernel for scRNA-seq data. To this end, we propose to automatically learn similarity information from data. We present a new clustering method in the form of a multiple kernel combination that can directly discover groupings in scRNA-seq data. The main proposition is that automatically learned similarity information from scRNA-seq data is used to transform the candidate solution into a new solution that better approximates the discrete one. The proposed model can be efficiently solved by the standard support vector machine (SVM) solvers. Experiments on benchmark scRNA-Seq data validate the superior performance of the proposed model. Spectral clustering with multiple kernels is implemented in Matlab, licensed under Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and freely available from the Github website, https://github.com/Cuteu/SMSC/.	360	0.9856262833675564	5	49	1	0.002777777777777778	7.83
10.1093/bib/bbaa273	FALSE	FALSE	scAPAtrap: identification and quantification of alternative polyadenylation sites from single-cell RNA-seq data	2020-11-03	Alternative polyadenylation (APA) generates diverse mRNA isoforms, which contributes to transcriptome diversity and gene expression regulation by affecting mRNA stability, translation and localization in cells. The rapid development of 3′ tag-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, such as CEL-seq and 10x Genomics, has led to the emergence of computational methods for identifying APA sites and profiling APA dynamics at single-cell resolution. However, existing methods fail to detect the precise location of poly(A) sites or sites with low read coverage. Moreover, they rely on priori genome annotation and can only detect poly(A) sites located within or near annotated genes. Here we proposed a tool called scAPAtrap for detecting poly(A) sites at the whole genome level in individual cells from 3′ tag-based scRNA-seq data. scAPAtrap incorporates peak identification and poly(A) read anchoring, enabling the identification of the precise location of poly(A) sites, even for sites with low read coverage. Moreover, scAPAtrap can identify poly(A) sites without using priori genome annotation, which helps locate novel poly(A) sites in previously overlooked regions and improve genome annotation. We compared scAPAtrap with two latest methods, scAPA and Sierra, using scRNA-seq data from different experimental technologies and species. Results show that scAPAtrap identified poly(A) sites with higher accuracy and sensitivity than competing methods and could be used to explore APA dynamics among cell types or the heterogeneous APA isoform expression in individual cells. scAPAtrap is available at https://github.com/BMILAB/scAPAtrap.	327	0.8952772073921971	5	66	4	0.012232415902140673	1.75

Thus, tools to analyze this data need to evolve as well as to improve accuracy and efficiency. We present FEATS, a Python software package, that performs clustering on single-cell RNA-seq data. FEATS is capable of performing multiple tasks such as estimating the number of clusters, conducting outlier detection and integrating data from various experiments. We develop a univariate feature selection-based approach for clustering, which involves the selection of top informative features to improve clustering performance. This is motivated by the fact that cell types are often manually determined using the expression of only a few known marker genes. On a variety of single-cell RNA-seq datasets, FEATS gives superior performance compared with the current tools, in terms of adjusted Rand index and estimating the number of clusters. It achieves a 22% improvement in clustering and more accurately estimates the number of clusters when compared with other tools. In addition to cluster estimation, FEATS also performs outlier detection and data integration while giving an excellent computational performance. Thus, FEATS is a comprehensive clustering tool capable of addressing the challenges during the clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data. The installation instructions and documentation of FEATS is available at https://edwinv87.github.io/feats/.

In this study, we present a single-cell RNA-sequencing data based multilayer network method (scMLnet) that models not only functional intercellular communications but also intracellular gene regulatory networks (https://github.com/SunXQlab/scMLnet). scMLnet was applied to a scRNA-seq dataset of COVID-19 patients to decipher the microenvironmental regulation of expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 that has been reported to be correlated with inflammatory cytokines and COVID-19 severity. The predicted elevation of ACE2 by extracellular cytokines EGF, IFN-γ or TNF-α were experimentally validated in human lung cells and the related signaling pathway were verified to be significantly activated during SARS-COV-2 infection. Our study provided a new approach to uncover inter-/intra-cellular signaling mechanisms of gene expression and revealed microenvironmental regulators of ACE2 expression, which may facilitate designing anti-cytokine therapies or targeted therapies for controlling COVID-19 infection. In addition, we summarized and compared different methods of scRNA-seq based inter-/intra-cellular signaling network inference for facilitating new methodology development and applications.	279	0.7638603696098563	4	43	8	0.02867383512544803	3.5

While computational methods for scRNAseq cell type clustering have advanced, the ability to integrate datasets to identify common and novel cell types across experiments remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a cluster-to-cluster cell type matching method—FR-Match—that utilizes supervised feature selection for dimensionality reduction and incorporates shared information among cells to determine whether two cell type clusters share the same underlying multivariate gene expression distribution. FR-Match is benchmarked with existing cell-to-cell and cell-to-cluster cell type matching methods using both simulated and real scRNAseq data. FR-Match proved to be a stringent method that produced fewer erroneous matches of distinct cell subtypes and had the unique ability to identify novel cell phenotypes in new datasets. In silico validation demonstrated that the proposed workflow is the only self-contained algorithm that was robust to increasing numbers of true negatives (i.e. non-represented cell types). FR-Match was applied to two human brain scRNAseq datasets sampled from cortical layer 1 and full thickness middle temporal gyrus. When mapping cell types identified in specimens isolated from these overlapping human brain regions, FR-Match precisely recapitulated the laminar characteristics of matched cell type clusters, reflecting their distinct neuroanatomical distributions. An R package and Shiny application are provided at https://github.com/JCVenterInstitute/FRmatch for users to interactively explore and match scRNAseq cell type clusters with complementary visualization tools.	300	0.8213552361396304	7	44	0	0	10.096

The most current clustering methods are designed for one data type only, such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) or sc-methylation data alone, and a few are developed for the integrative analysis of multiple data types. The integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell genomic data sets leverages the power in multiple data sets and can deepen the biological insight. In this paper, we propose a coupled co-clustering-based unsupervised transfer learning algorithm (coupleCoC) for the integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell data. Our proposed coupleCoC builds upon the information theoretic co-clustering framework. In co-clustering, both the cells and the genomic features are simultaneously clustered. Clustering similar genomic features reduces the noise in single-cell data and facilitates transfer of knowledge across single-cell datasets. We applied coupleCoC for the integrative analysis of scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data, sc-methylation and scRNA-seq data and scRNA-seq data from mouse and human. We demonstrate that coupleCoC improves the overall clustering performance and matches the cell subpopulations across multimodal single-cell genomic datasets. Our method coupleCoC is also computationally efficient and can scale up to large datasets.Availability: The software and datasets are available at https://github.com/cuhklinlab/coupleCoC.	293	0.8021902806297057	3	57	3	0.010238907849829351	9.83

Advances in biotechnologies make it possible to generate scRNA-seq profiles for large-scale cells, requiring effective and efficient clustering algorithms to identify cell types and informative genes. Although great efforts have been devoted to clustering of scRNA-seq, the accuracy, scalability and interpretability of available algorithms are not desirable. In this study, we solve these problems by developing a joint learning algorithm [a.k.a. joints sparse representation and clustering (jSRC)], where the dimension reduction (DR) and clustering are integrated. Specifically, DR is employed for the scalability and joint learning improves accuracy. To increase the interpretability of patterns, we assume that cells within the same type have similar expression patterns, where the sparse representation is imposed on features. We transform clustering of scRNA-seq into an optimization problem and then derive the update rules to optimize the objective of jSRC. Fifteen scRNA-seq datasets from various tissues and organisms are adopted to validate the performance of jSRC, where the number of single cells varies from 49 to 110 824. The experimental results demonstrate that jSRC significantly outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in terms of various measurements (on average 20.29% by improvement) with fewer running time. Furthermore, jSRC is efficient and robust across different scRNA-seq datasets from various tissues. Finally, jSRC also accurately identifies dynamic cell types associated with progression of COVID-19. The proposed model and methods provide an effective strategy to analyze scRNA-seq data (the software is coded using MATLAB and is free for academic purposes; https://github.com/xkmaxidian/jSRC).	235	0.6433949349760438	3	67	1	0.00425531914893617	11.83
10.1093/bib/bbab034	FALSE	FALSE	Accurate feature selection improves single-cell RNA-seq cell clustering	2021-02-22	Cell clustering is one of the most important and commonly performed tasks in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. An important step in cell clustering is to select a subset of genes (referred to as ‘features’), whose expression patterns will then be used for downstream clustering. A good set of features should include the ones that distinguish different cell types, and the quality of such set could have a significant impact on the clustering accuracy. All existing scRNA-seq clustering tools include a feature selection step relying on some simple unsupervised feature selection methods, mostly based on the statistical moments of gene-wise expression distributions. In this work, we carefully evaluate the impact of feature selection on cell clustering accuracy. In addition, we develop a feature selection algorithm named FEAture SelecTion (FEAST), which provides more representative features. We apply the method on 12 public scRNA-seq datasets and demonstrate that using features selected by FEAST with existing clustering tools significantly improve the clustering accuracy.	216	0.5913757700205339	3	51	2	0.009259259259259259	4.45

Compared to flow or mass cytometry, scRNA-Seq could potentially identify cell types and activation states that lack precise cell surface markers. However, scRNA-Seq is currently limited due to the need to manually classify each immune cell from its transcriptional profile. While recently developed algorithms accurately annotate coarse cell types (e.g. T cells versus macrophages), making fine distinctions (e.g. CD8+ effector memory T cells) remains a difficult challenge. To address this, we developed a machine learning classifier called ImmClassifier that leverages a hierarchical ontology of cell type. We demonstrate that its predictions are highly concordant with flow-based markers from CITE-seq and outperforms other tools (+15% recall, +14% precision) in distinguishing fine-grained cell types with comparable performance on coarse ones. Thus, ImmClassifier can be used to explore more deeply the heterogeneity of the immune system in scRNA-Seq experiments.	207	0.5667351129363449	8	49	0	0	3.25
10.1093/bib/bbab085	FALSE	FALSE	WEDGE: imputation of gene expression values from single-cell RNA-seq datasets using biased matrix decomposition	2021-04-08	The low capture rate of expressed RNAs from single-cell sequencing technology is one of the major obstacles to downstream functional genomics analyses. Recently, a number of imputation methods have emerged for single-cell transcriptome data, however, recovering missing values in very sparse expression matrices remains a substantial challenge. Here, we propose a new algorithm, WEDGE (WEighted Decomposition of Gene Expression), to impute gene expression matrices by using a biased low-rank matrix decomposition method. WEDGE successfully recovered expression matrices, reproduced the cell-wise and gene-wise correlations and improved the clustering of cells, performing impressively for applications with sparse datasets. Overall, this study shows a potent approach for imputing sparse expression matrix data, and our WEDGE algorithm should help many researchers to more profitably explore the biological meanings embedded in their single-cell RNA sequencing datasets.

10.1093/bib/bbab122	FALSE	FALSE	iSMNN: batch effect correction for single-cell RNA-seq data via iterative supervised mutual nearest neighbor refinement	2021-04-12	Batch effect correction is an essential step in the integrative analysis of multiple single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. One state-of-the-art strategy for batch effect correction is via unsupervised or supervised detection of mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs). However, both types of methods only detect MNNs across batches of uncorrected data, where the large batch effects may affect the MNN search. To address this issue, we presented a batch effect correction approach via iterative supervised MNN (iSMNN) refinement across data after correction. Our benchmarking on both simulation and real datasets showed the advantages of the iterative refinement of MNNs on the performance of correction. Compared to popular alternative methods, our iSMNN is able to better mix the cells of the same cell type across batches. In addition, iSMNN can also facilitate the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are relevant to the biological function of certain cell types. These results indicated that iSMNN will be a valuable method for integrating multiple scRNA-seq datasets that can facilitate biological and medical studies at single-cell level.	167	0.45722108145106094	9	26	0	0	2.25
10.1093/bib/bbab142	FALSE	FALSE	Deep learning of gene relationships from single cell time-course expression data	2021-04-20	Time-course gene-expression data have been widely used to infer regulatory and signaling relationships between genes. Most of the widely used methods for such analysis were developed for bulk expression data. Single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data offer several advantages including the large number of expression profiles available and the ability to focus on individual cells rather than averages. However, the data also raise new computational challenges. Using a novel encoding for scRNA-Seq expression data, we develop deep learning methods for interaction prediction from time-course data. Our methods use a supervised framework which represents the data as 3D tensor and train convolutional and recurrent neural networks for predicting interactions. We tested our time-course deep learning (TDL) models on five different time-series scRNA-Seq datasets. As we show, TDL can accurately identify causal and regulatory gene–gene interactions and can also be used to assign new function to genes. TDL improves on prior methods for the above tasks and can be generally applied to new time-series scRNA-Seq data.	159	0.4353182751540041	2	37	1	0.006289308176100629	2.5
10.1093/bib/bbab204	FALSE	FALSE	REBET: a method to determine the number of cell clusters based on batch effect removal	2021-06-15	In single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data analysis, a fundamental problem is to determine the number of cell clusters based on the gene expression profiles. However, the performance of current methods is still far from satisfactory, presumably due to their limitations in capturing the expression variability among cell clusters. Batch effects represent the undesired variability between data measured in different batches. When data are obtained from different labs or protocols batch effects occur. Motivated by the practice of batch effect removal, we considered cell clusters as batches. We hypothesized that the number of cell clusters (i.e. batches) could be correctly determined if the variances among clusters (i.e. batch effects) were removed. We developed a new method, namely, removal of batch effect and testing (REBET), for determining the number of cell clusters. In this method, cells are first partitioned into k clusters. Second, the batch effects among these k clusters are then removed. Third, the quality of batch effect removal is evaluated with the average range of normalized mutual information (ARNMI), which measures how uniformly the cells with batch-effects-removal are mixed. By testing a range of k values, the k value that corresponds to the lowest ARNMI is determined to be the optimal number of clusters. We compared REBET with state-of-the-art methods on 32 simulated datasets and 14 published scRNA-seq datasets. The results show that REBET can accurately and robustly estimate the number of cell clusters and outperform existing methods. Contact: H.D.L. (hongdong@csu.edu.cn) or Q.S.X.

10.1093/bib/bbab236	FALSE	FALSE	Consensus clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data by enhancing network affinity	2021-06-23	Elucidation of cell subpopulations at high resolution is a key and challenging goal of single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Although unsupervised clustering methods have been proposed for de novo identification of cell populations, their performance and robustness suffer from the high variability, low capture efficiency and high dropout rates which are characteristic of scRNA-seq experiments. Here, we present a novel unsupervised method for Single-cell Clustering by Enhancing Network Affinity (SCENA), which mainly employed three strategies: selecting multiple gene sets, enhancing local affinity among cells and clustering of consensus matrices. Large-scale validations on 13 real scRNA-seq datasets show that SCENA has high accuracy in detecting cell populations and is robust against dropout noise. When we applied SCENA to large-scale scRNA-seq data of mouse brain cells, known cell types were successfully detected, and novel cell types of interneurons were identified with differential expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunits and transporters. SCENA is equipped with CPU + GPU (Central Processing Units + Graphics Processing Units) heterogeneous parallel computing to achieve high running speed. The high performance and running speed of SCENA combine into a new and efficient platform for biological discoveries in clustering analysis of large and diverse scRNA-seq datasets.	95	0.2600958247775496	6	74	0	0	11.096
10.1093/bib/bbab321	FALSE	FALSE	ScCAEs: deep clustering of single-cell RNA-seq via convolutional autoencoder embedding and soft K-means	2021-09-02	Clustering and cell type classification are a vital step of analyzing scRNA-seq data to reveal the complexity of the tissue (e.g. the number of cell types and the transcription characteristics of the respective cell type). Recently, deep learning-based single-cell clustering algorithms become popular since they integrate the dimensionality reduction with clustering. But these methods still have unstable clustering effects for the scRNA-seq datasets with high dropouts or noise. In this study, a novel single-cell RNA-seq deep embedding clustering via convolutional autoencoder embedding and soft K-means (scCAEs) is proposed by simultaneously learning the feature representation and clustering. It integrates the deep learning with convolutional autoencoder to characterize scRNA-seq data and proposes a regularized soft K-means algorithm to cluster cell populations in a learned latent space. Next, a novel constraint is introduced to the clustering objective function to iteratively optimize the clustering results, and more importantly, it is theoretically proved that this objective function optimization ensures the convergence. Moreover, it adds the reconstruction loss to the objective function combining the dimensionality reduction with clustering to find a more suitable embedding space for clustering. The proposed method is validated on a variety of datasets, in which the number of clusters in the mentioned datasets ranges from 4 to 46, and the number of cells ranges from 90 to 30 302. The experimental results show that scCAEs is superior to other state-of-the-art methods on the mentioned datasets, and it also keeps the satisfying compatibility and robustness. In addition, for single-cell datasets with the batch effects, scCAEs can ensure the cell separation while removing batch effects.	24	0.06570841889117043	5	65	0	0	1.75
10.1093/bib/bbab325	FALSE	FALSE	DeepDRIM: a deep neural network to reconstruct cell-type-specific gene regulatory network using single-cell RNA-seq data	2021-08-23	Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled to capture the gene activities at single-cell resolution, thus allowing reconstruction of cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs). The available algorithms for reconstructing GRNs are commonly designed for bulk RNA-seq data, and few of them are applicable to analyze scRNA-seq data by dealing with the dropout events and cellular heterogeneity. In this paper, we represent the joint gene expression distribution of a gene pair as an image and propose a novel supervised deep neural network called DeepDRIM which utilizes the image of the target TF-gene pair and the ones of the potential neighbors to reconstruct GRN from scRNA-seq data. Due to the consideration of TF-gene pair’s neighborhood context, DeepDRIM can effectively eliminate the false positives caused by transitive gene–gene interactions. We compared DeepDRIM with nine GRN reconstruction algorithms designed for either bulk or single-cell RNA-seq data. It achieves evidently better performance for the scRNA-seq data collected from eight cell lines. The simulated data show that DeepDRIM is robust to the dropout rate, the cell number and the size of the training data. We further applied DeepDRIM to the scRNA-seq gene expression of B cells from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the patients with mild and severe coronavirus disease 2019. We focused on the cell-type-specific GRN alteration and observed targets of TFs that were differentially expressed between the two statuses to be enriched in lysosome, apoptosis, response to decreased oxygen level and microtubule, which had been proved to be associated with coronavirus infection.	34	0.09308692676249145	8	67	0	0	11.796
10.1093/bib/bbab366	FALSE	FALSE	Integrating single-cell datasets with ambiguous batch information by incorporating molecular network features	2021-09-21	With the rapid development of single-cell sequencing techniques, several large-scale cell atlas projects have been launched across the world. However, it is still challenging to integrate single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets with diverse tissue sources, developmental stages and/or few overlaps, due to the ambiguity in determining the batch information, which is particularly important for current batch-effect correction methods. Here, we present SCORE, a simple network-based integration methodology, which incorporates curated molecular network features to infer cellular states and generate a unified workflow for integrating scRNA-seq datasets. Validating on real single-cell datasets, we showed that regardless of batch information, SCORE outperforms existing methods in accuracy, robustness, scalability and data integration.	5	0.013689253935660506	12	42	0	0	2

10.1093/bib/bby076	FALSE	FALSE	Impact of similarity metrics on single-cell RNA-seq data clustering	2018-08-22	Advances in high-throughput sequencing on single-cell gene expressions [single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)] have enabled transcriptome profiling on individual cells from complex samples. A common goal in scRNA-seq data analysis is to discover and characterise cell types, typically through clustering methods. The quality of the clustering therefore plays a critical role in biological discovery. While numerous clustering algorithms have been proposed for scRNA-seq data, fundamentally they all rely on a similarity metric for categorising individual cells. Although several studies have compared the performance of various clustering algorithms for scRNA-seq data, currently there is no benchmark of different similarity metrics and their influence on scRNA-seq data clustering. Here, we compared a panel of similarity metrics on clustering a collection of annotated scRNA-seq datasets. Within each dataset, a stratified subsampling procedure was applied and an array of evaluation measures was employed to assess the similarity metrics. This produced a highly reliable and reproducible consensus on their performance assessment. Overall, we found that correlation-based metrics (e.g. Pearson’s correlation) outperformed distance-based metrics (e.g. Euclidean distance). To test if the use of correlation-based metrics can benefit the recently published clustering techniques for scRNA-seq data, we modified a state-of-the-art kernel-based clustering algorithm (SIMLR) using Pearson’s correlation as a similarity measure and found significant performance improvement over Euclidean distance on scRNA-seq data clustering. These findings demonstrate the importance of similarity metrics in clustering scRNA-seq data and highlight Pearson’s correlation as a favourable choice. Further comparison on different scRNA-seq library preparation protocols suggests that they may also affect clustering performance. Finally, the benchmarking framework is available at http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/SMS/bioinformatics/software.html.	1131	3.0965092402464065	6	60	43	0.03801945181255526	23.946

However, existing computational methods are inadequately scalable to large datasets and therefore cannot uncover the complex cellular heterogeneity. We introduce a highly scalable graph-based clustering algorithm PARC—Phenotyping by Accelerated Refined Community-partitioning—for large-scale, high-dimensional single-cell data (&amp;gt;1 million cells). Using large single-cell flow and mass cytometry, RNA-seq and imaging-based biophysical data, we demonstrate that PARC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art clustering algorithms without subsampling of cells, including Phenograph, FlowSOM and Flock, in terms of both speed and ability to robustly detect rare cell populations. For example, PARC can cluster a single-cell dataset of 1.1 million cells within 13 min, compared with &amp;gt;2 h for the next fastest graph-clustering algorithm. Our work presents a scalable algorithm to cope with increasingly large-scale single-cell analysis. https://github.com/ShobiStassen/PARC.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa087	FALSE	FALSE	Statistical significance of cluster membership for unsupervised evaluation of single cell identities	2020-03-06	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to dissect transcriptional heterogeneity arising from cellular types, spatio-temporal contexts and environmental stimuli. Transcriptional heterogeneity may reflect phenotypes and molecular signatures that are often unmeasured or unknown a priori. Cell identities of samples derived from heterogeneous subpopulations are then determined by clustering of scRNA-seq data. These cell identities are used in downstream analyses. How can we examine if cell identities are accurately inferred? Unlike external measurements or labels for single cells, using clustering-based cell identities result in spurious signals and false discoveries. We introduce non-parametric methods to evaluate cell identities by testing cluster memberships in an unsupervised manner. Diverse simulation studies demonstrate accuracy of the jackstraw test for cluster membership. We propose a posterior probability that a cell should be included in that clustering-based subpopulation. Posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) for cluster memberships can be used to select and visualize samples relevant to subpopulations. The proposed methods are applied on three scRNA-seq datasets. First, a mixture of Jurkat and 293T cell lines provides two distinct cellular populations. Second, Cell Hashing yields cell identities corresponding to eight donors which are independently analyzed by the jackstraw. Third, peripheral blood mononuclear cells are used to explore heterogeneous immune populations. The proposed P-values and PIPs lead to probabilistic feature selection of single cells that can be visualized using principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and others. By learning uncertainty in clustering high-dimensional data, the proposed methods enable unsupervised evaluation of cluster membership. https://cran.r-project.org/package=jackstraw.

We have developed a zero-inflation-adjusted quantile (ZIAQ) algorithm, which is the first method to account for both dropout rates and complex scRNA-seq data distributions in the same model. ZIAQ demonstrates superior performance over several existing methods on simulated scRNA-seq datasets by finding more differentially expressed genes. When ZIAQ was applied to the comparison of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells from a human glioblastoma dataset, the ranking of biologically relevant genes and pathways showed clear improvement over existing methods.

Existing implementations for inferring its parameters from data often struggle with the size of single cell datasets, which can comprise millions of cells; at the same time, they do not take full advantage of the fact that zero and other small numbers are frequent in the data. These limitations have hampered uptake of the model, leaving room for statistically inferior approaches such as logarithm(-like) transformation. We present a new R package for fitting the Gamma-Poisson distribution to data with the characteristics of modern single cell datasets more quickly and more accurately than existing methods.

Due to technical defects, dropout events in scRNA-seq will add noise to the gene-cell expression matrix and hinder downstream analysis. Therefore, it is important for recovering the true gene expression levels before carrying out downstream analysis. In this article, we develop an imputation method, called scTSSR, to recover gene expression for scRNA-seq. Unlike most existing methods that impute dropout events by borrowing information across only genes or cells, scTSSR simultaneously leverages information from both similar genes and similar cells using a two-side sparse self-representation model. We demonstrate that scTSSR can effectively capture the Gini coefficients of genes and gene-to-gene correlations observed in single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smRNA FISH). Down-sampling experiments indicate that scTSSR performs better than existing methods in recovering the true gene expression levels. We also show that scTSSR has a competitive performance in differential expression analysis, cell clustering and cell trajectory inference.

However, scRNA-seq data analysis remains challenging because of various technical noises such as dropout events (i.e. excessive zero counts in the expression matrix). By taking consideration of the association among cells and genes, we propose a novel collaborative matrix factorization-based method called CMF-Impute to impute the dropout entries of a given scRNA-seq expression matrix. We test CMF-Impute and compare it with the other five state-of-the-art methods on six popular real scRNA-seq datasets of various sizes and three simulated datasets. For simulated datasets, CMF-Impute outperforms other methods in imputing the closest dropouts to the original expression values as evaluated by both the sum of squared error and Pearson correlation coefficient. For real datasets, CMF-Impute achieves the most accurate cell classification results in spite of the choice of different clustering methods like SC3 or T-SNE followed by K-means as evaluated by both adjusted rand index and normalized mutual information. Finally, we demonstrate that CMF-Impute is powerful in reconstructing cell-to-cell and gene-to-gene correlation, and in inferring cell lineage trajectories.

Nevertheless, scRNA-seq often fails to capture expressed genes, leading to the prominent dropout problem. These dropouts cause many problems in down-stream analysis, such as significant increase of noises, power loss in differential expression analysis and obscuring of gene-to-gene or cell-to-cell relationship. Imputation of these dropout values can be beneficial in scRNA-seq data analysis. In this article, we model the dropout imputation problem as robust matrix decomposition. This model has minimal assumptions and allows us to develop a computational efficient imputation method called scRMD. Extensive data analysis shows that scRMD can accurately recover the dropout values and help to improve downstream analysis such as differential expression analysis and clustering analysis.

In spite of myriad advances, recovering interpretable biological signal from data corrupted by technical noise remains a prevalent open problem. Several classes of procedures, among them classical dimensionality reduction techniques and others incorporating subject-matter knowledge, have provided effective advances. However, no procedure currently satisfies the dual objectives of recovering stable and relevant features simultaneously. Inspired by recent proposals for making use of control data in the removal of unwanted variation, we propose a variant of principal component analysis (PCA), sparse contrastive PCA that extracts sparse, stable, interpretable and relevant biological signal.

In this article, we propose a novel procedure to directly estimate t-SNE embeddings that are not driven by batch effects. Without correction, interesting structure in the data can be obscured by batch effects. The proposed algorithm can therefore significantly aid visualization of high-dimensional data. The proposed methods are based on linear algebra and constrained optimization, leading to efficient algorithms and fast computation in many high-dimensional settings. Results on artificial single-cell transcription profiling data show that the proposed procedure successfully removes multiple batch effects from t-SNE embeddings, while retaining fundamental information on cell types. When applied to single-cell gene expression data to investigate mouse medulloblastoma, the proposed method successfully removes batches related with mice identifiers and the date of the experiment, while preserving clusters of oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and endothelial cells and microglia, which are expected to lie in the stroma within or adjacent to the tumours.

Single-cell gene expression assays have the potential to further resolve these expression patterns, but currently available methods do not perform allele-specific quantification at the molecule level. Here, we present scHLAcount, a post-processing workflow for single-cell RNA-seq data that computes allele-specific molecule counts of the HLA genes based on a personalized reference constructed from the sample’s HLA genotypes. scHLAcount is available under the MIT license at https://github.com/10XGenomics/scHLAcount.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa269	FALSE	FALSE	alona: a web server for single cell RNA-seq analysis	2020-04-23	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a technology to measure gene expression in single cells. It has enabled discovery of new cell types and established cell type atlases of tissues and organs. The widespread adoption of scRNA-seq has created a need for user-friendly software for data analysis. We have developed a web server, alona that incorporates several of the most popular single-cell analysis algorithms into a flexible pipeline. alona can perform quality filtering, normalization, batch correction, clustering, cell type annotation and differential gene expression analysis. Data are visualized in the web browser using an interface based on JavaScript, allowing the user to query genes of interest and visualize the cluster structure. alona accepts a compressed gene expression matrix and identifies cell clusters with a graph-based clustering strategy. Cell types are identified from a comprehensive collection of marker genes or by specifying a custom set of marker genes.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa282	FALSE	FALSE	CiteFuse enables multi-modal analysis of CITE-seq data	2020-04-30	Multi-modal profiling of single cells represents one of the latest technological advancements in molecular biology. Among various single-cell multi-modal strategies, cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) allows simultaneous quantification of two distinct species: RNA and cell-surface proteins. Here, we introduce CiteFuse, a streamlined package consisting of a suite of tools for doublet detection, modality integration, clustering, differential RNA and protein expression analysis, antibody-derived tag evaluation, ligand–receptor interaction analysis and interactive web-based visualization of CITE-seq data. We demonstrate the capacity of CiteFuse to integrate the two data modalities and its relative advantage against data generated from single-modality profiling using both simulations and real-world CITE-seq data. Furthermore, we illustrate a novel doublet detection method based on a combined index of cell hashing and transcriptome data. Finally, we demonstrate CiteFuse for predicting ligand–receptor interactions by using multi-modal CITE-seq data. Collectively, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of CiteFuse for the integrative analysis of transcriptome and epitope profiles from CITE-seq data.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa283	FALSE	FALSE	scDoc: correcting drop-out events in single-cell RNA-seq data	2020-05-04	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become an important tool to unravel cellular heterogeneity, discover new cell (sub)types, and understand cell development at single-cell resolution. However, one major challenge to scRNA-seq research is the presence of ‘drop-out’ events, which usually is due to extremely low mRNA input or the stochastic nature of gene expression. In this article, we present a novel single-cell RNA-seq drop-out correction (scDoc) method, imputing drop-out events by borrowing information for the same gene from highly similar cells. scDoc is the first method that directly involves drop-out information to accounting for cell-to-cell similarity estimation, which is crucial in scRNA-seq drop-out imputation but has not been appropriately examined. We evaluated the performance of scDoc using both simulated data and real scRNA-seq studies. Results show that scDoc outperforms the existing imputation methods in reference to data visualization, cell subpopulation identification and differential expression detection in scRNA-seq data. R code is available at https://github.com/anlingUA/scDoc. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	510	1.3963039014373717	4	49	1	0.00196078431372549	9.5
10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa293	FALSE	FALSE	scVAE: variational auto-encoders for single-cell gene expression data	2020-05-16	Models for analysing and making relevant biological inferences from massive amounts of complex single-cell transcriptomic data typically require several individual data-processing steps, each with their own set of hyperparameter choices. With deep generative models one can work directly with count data, make likelihood-based model comparison, learn a latent representation of the cells and capture more of the variability in different cell populations. We propose a novel method based on variational auto-encoders (VAEs) for analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. It avoids data preprocessing by using raw count data as input and can robustly estimate the expected gene expression levels and a latent representation for each cell. We tested several count likelihood functions and a variant of the VAE that has a priori clustering in the latent space. We show for several scRNA-seq datasets that our method outperforms recently proposed scRNA-seq methods in clustering cells and that the resulting clusters reflect cell types. Our method, called scVAE, is implemented in Python using the TensorFlow machine-learning library, and it is freely available at https://github.com/scvae/scvae.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa443	FALSE	FALSE	Unsupervised topological alignment for single-cell multi-omics integration	2020-07-13	Single-cell multi-omics data provide a comprehensive molecular view of cells. However, single-cell multi-omics datasets consist of unpaired cells measured with distinct unmatched features across modalities, making data integration challenging. In this study, we present a novel algorithm, termed UnionCom, for the unsupervised topological alignment of single-cell multi-omics integration. UnionCom does not require any correspondence information, either among cells or among features. It first embeds the intrinsic low-dimensional structure of each single-cell dataset into a distance matrix of cells within the same dataset and then aligns the cells across single-cell multi-omics datasets by matching the distance matrices via a matrix optimization method. Finally, it projects the distinct unmatched features across single-cell datasets into a common embedding space for feature comparability of the aligned cells. To match the complex non-linear geometrical distorted low-dimensional structures across datasets, UnionCom proposes and adjusts a global scaling parameter on distance matrices for aligning similar topological structures. It does not require one-to-one correspondence among cells across datasets, and it can accommodate samples with dataset-specific cell types. UnionCom outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real single-cell multi-omics datasets. UnionCom is robust to parameter choices, as well as subsampling of features. UnionCom software is available at https://github.com/caokai1073/UnionCom. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	440	1.2046543463381245	4	27	18	0.04090909090909091	2.25
10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa450	FALSE	FALSE	A Bayesian framework for inter-cellular information sharing improves dscRNA-seq quantification	2020-07-13	Droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq (dscRNA-seq) data are being generated at an unprecedented pace, and the accurate estimation of gene-level abundances for each cell is a crucial first step in most dscRNA-seq analyses. When pre-processing the raw dscRNA-seq data to generate a count matrix, care must be taken to account for the potentially large number of multi-mapping locations per read. The sparsity of dscRNA-seq data, and the strong 3’ sampling bias, makes it difficult to disambiguate cases where there is no uniquely mapping read to any of the candidate target genes. We introduce a Bayesian framework for information sharing across cells within a sample, or across multiple modalities of data using the same sample, to improve gene quantification estimates for dscRNA-seq data. We use an anchor-based approach to connect cells with similar gene-expression patterns, and learn informative, empirical priors which we provide to alevin’s gene multi-mapping resolution algorithm. This improves the quantification estimates for genes with no uniquely mapping reads (i.e. when there is no unique intra-cellular information). We show our new model improves the per cell gene-level estimates and provides a principled framework for information sharing across multiple modalities. We test our method on a combination of simulated and real datasets under various setups. The information sharing model is included in alevin and is implemented in C++14. It is available as open-source software, under GPL v3, at https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon as of version 1.1.0.	440	1.2046543463381245	4	43	0	0	5.2
10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa463	FALSE	FALSE	TinGa: fast and flexible trajectory inference with Growing Neural Gas	2020-07-13	During the last decade, trajectory inference (TI) methods have emerged as a novel framework to model cell developmental dynamics, most notably in the area of single-cell transcriptomics. At present, more than 70 TI methods have been published, and recent benchmarks showed that even state-of-the-art methods only perform well for certain trajectory types but not others.In this work, we present TinGa, a new TI model that is fast and flexible, and that is based on Growing Neural Graphs. We performed an extensive comparison of TinGa to five state-of-the-art methods for TI on a set of 250 datasets, including both synthetic as well as real datasets. Overall, TinGa improves the state-of-the-art by producing accurate models (comparable to or an improvement on the state-of-the-art) on the whole spectrum of data complexity, from the simplest linear datasets to the most complex disconnected graphs. In addition, TinGa obtained the fastest execution times, showing that our method is thus one of the most versatile methods up to date.R scripts for running TinGa, comparing it to top existing methods and generating the figures of this article are available at https://github.com/Helena-todd/TinGa.	440	1.2046543463381245	4	20	7	0.015909090909090907	1.25
10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa576	FALSE	FALSE	Gene regulation inference from single-cell RNA-seq data with linear differential equations and velocity inference	2020-06-17	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers new possibilities to infer gene regulatory network (GRNs) for biological processes involving a notion of time, such as cell differentiation or cell cycles. It also raises many challenges due to the destructive measurements inherent to the technology. In this work, we propose a new method named GRISLI for de novo GRN inference from scRNA-seq data. GRISLI infers a velocity vector field in the space of scRNA-seq data from profiles of individual cells, and models the dynamics of cell trajectories with a linear ordinary differential equation to reconstruct the underlying GRN with a sparse regression procedure. We show on real data that GRISLI outperforms a recently proposed state-of-the-art method for GRN reconstruction from scRNA-seq data. The MATLAB code of GRISLI is available at: https://github.com/PCAubin/GRISLI. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	466	1.2758384668035592	2	37	13	0.027896995708154508	9.33
10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa607	FALSE	FALSE	Simulation, Power Evaluation, and Sample Size Recommendation for Single Cell RNA-seq	2020-07-02	Determining the sample size for adequate power to detect statistical significance is a crucial step at the design stage for high-throughput experiments. Even though a number of methods and tools are available for sample size calculation for microarray and RNA-seq in the context of differential expression (DE), this topic in the field of single-cell RNA sequencing is understudied. Moreover, the unique data characteristics present in scRNA-seq such as sparsity and heterogeneity increase the challenge. We propose POWSC, a simulation-based method, to provide power evaluation and sample size recommendation for single-cell RNA-sequencing DE analysis. POWSC consists of a data simulator that creates realistic expression data, and a power assessor that provides a comprehensive evaluation and visualization of the power and sample size relationship. The data simulator in POWSC outperforms two other state-of-art simulators in capturing key characteristics of real datasets. The power assessor in POWSC provides a variety of power evaluations including stratified and marginal power analyses for DEs characterized by two forms (phase transition or magnitude tuning), under different comparison scenarios. In addition, POWSC offers information for optimizing the tradeoffs between sample size and sequencing depth with the same total reads.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa611	FALSE	FALSE	Scirpy: a Scanpy extension for analyzing single-cell T-cell receptor-sequencing data	2020-07-02	Advances in single-cell technologies have enabled the investigation of T-cell phenotypes and repertoires at unprecedented resolution and scale. Bioinformatic methods for the efficient analysis of these large-scale datasets are instrumental for advancing our understanding of adaptive immune responses. However, while well-established solutions are accessible for the processing of single-cell transcriptomes, no streamlined pipelines are available for the comprehensive characterization of T-cell receptors. Here, we propose single-cell immune repertoires in Python (Scirpy), a scalable Python toolkit that provides simplified access to the analysis and visualization of immune repertoires from single cells and seamless integration with transcriptomic data.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa800	FALSE	FALSE	Conditional out-of-distribution generation for unpaired data using transfer VAE	2020-12-29	While generative models have shown great success in sampling high-dimensional samples conditional on low-dimensional descriptors (stroke thickness in MNIST, hair color in CelebA, speaker identity in WaveNet), their generation out-of-distribution poses fundamental problems due to the difficulty of learning compact joint distribution across conditions. The canonical example of the conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), for instance, does not explicitly relate conditions during training and, hence, has no explicit incentive of learning such a compact representation. We overcome the limitation of the CVAE by matching distributions across conditions using maximum mean discrepancy in the decoder layer that follows the bottleneck. This introduces a strong regularization both for reconstructing samples within the same condition and for transforming samples across conditions, resulting in much improved generalization. As this amount to solving a style-transfer problem, we refer to the model as transfer VAE (trVAE). Benchmarking trVAE on high-dimensional image and single-cell RNA-seq, we demonstrate higher robustness and higher accuracy than existing approaches. We also show qualitatively improved predictions by tackling previously problematic minority classes and multiple conditions in the context of cellular perturbation response to treatment and disease based on high-dimensional single-cell gene expression data. For generic tasks, we improve Pearson correlations of high-dimensional estimated means and variances with their ground truths from 0.89 to 0.97 and 0.75 to 0.87, respectively. We further demonstrate that trVAE learns cell-type-specific responses after perturbation and improves the prediction of most cell-type-specific genes by 65%.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa816	FALSE	FALSE	SCHNEL: scalable clustering of high dimensional single-cell data	2020-12-29	Single cell data measures multiple cellular markers at the single-cell level for thousands to millions of cells. Identification of distinct cell populations is a key step for further biological understanding, usually performed by clustering this data. Dimensionality reduction based clustering tools are either not scalable to large datasets containing millions of cells, or not fully automated requiring an initial manual estimation of the number of clusters. Graph clustering tools provide automated and reliable clustering for single cell data, but suffer heavily from scalability to large datasets. We developed SCHNEL, a scalable, reliable and automated clustering tool for high-dimensional single-cell data. SCHNEL transforms large high-dimensional data to a hierarchy of datasets containing subsets of data points following the original data manifold. The novel approach of SCHNEL combines this hierarchical representation of the data with graph clustering, making graph clustering scalable to millions of cells. Using seven different cytometry datasets, SCHNEL outperformed three popular clustering tools for cytometry data, and was able to produce meaningful clustering results for datasets of 3.5 and 17.2 million cells within workable time frames. In addition, we show that SCHNEL is a general clustering tool by applying it to single-cell RNA sequencing data, as well as a popular machine learning benchmark dataset MNIST. Implementation is available on GitHub (https://github.com/biovault/SCHNELpy). All datasets used in this study are publicly available.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa843	FALSE	FALSE	SCIM: universal single-cell matching with unpaired feature sets	2020-12-29	Recent technological advances have led to an increase in the production and availability of single-cell data. The ability to integrate a set of multi-technology measurements would allow the identification of biologically or clinically meaningful observations through the unification of the perspectives afforded by each technology. In most cases, however, profiling technologies consume the used cells and thus pairwise correspondences between datasets are lost. Due to the sheer size single-cell datasets can acquire, scalable algorithms that are able to universally match single-cell measurements carried out in one cell to its corresponding sibling in another technology are needed. We propose Single-Cell data Integration via Matching (SCIM), a scalable approach to recover such correspondences in two or more technologies. SCIM assumes that cells share a common (low-dimensional) underlying structure and that the underlying cell distribution is approximately constant across technologies. It constructs a technology-invariant latent space using an autoencoder framework with an adversarial objective. Multi-modal datasets are integrated by pairing cells across technologies using a bipartite matching scheme that operates on the low-dimensional latent representations. We evaluate SCIM on a simulated cellular branching process and show that the cell-to-cell matches derived by SCIM reflect the same pseudotime on the simulated dataset. Moreover, we apply our method to two real-world scenarios, a melanoma tumor sample and a human bone marrow sample, where we pair cells from a scRNA dataset to their sibling cells in a CyTOF dataset achieving 90% and 78% cell-matching accuracy for each one of the samples, respectively. https://github.com/ratschlab/scim.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa908	FALSE	FALSE	Single-cell RNA-seq data semi-supervised clustering and annotation via structural regularized domain adaptation	2020-10-24	The rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies allows us to explore tissue heterogeneity at the cellular level. The identification of cell types plays an essential role in the analysis of scRNA-seq data, which, in turn, influences the discovery of regulatory genes that induce heterogeneity. As the scale of sequencing data increases, the classical method of combining clustering and differential expression analysis to annotate cells becomes more costly in terms of both labor and resources. Existing scRNA-seq supervised classification method can alleviate this issue through learning a classifier trained on the labeled reference data and then making a prediction based on the unlabeled target data. However, such label transference strategy carries with risks, such as susceptibility to batch effect and further compromise of inherent discrimination of target data. In this article, inspired by unsupervised domain adaptation, we propose a flexible single cell semi-supervised clustering and annotation framework, scSemiCluster, which integrates the reference data and target data for training. We utilize structure similarity regularization on the reference domain to restrict the clustering solutions of the target domain. We also incorporates pairwise constraints in the feature learning process such that cells belonging to the same cluster are close to each other, and cells belonging to different clusters are far from each other in the latent space. Notably, without explicit domain alignment and batch effect correction, scSemiCluster outperforms other state-of-the-art, single-cell supervised classification and semi-supervised clustering annotation algorithms in both simulation and real data. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use both deep discriminative clustering and deep generative clustering techniques in the single-cell field. An implementation of scSemiCluster is available from https://github.com/xuebaliang/scSemiCluster.

However, subpopulations can have only subtle transcriptomic differences and the high dimensionality of the data makes their identification challenging. We introduce ILoReg, an R package implementing a new cell population identification method that improves identification of cell populations with subtle differences through a probabilistic feature extraction step that is applied before clustering and visualization. The feature extraction is performed using a novel machine learning algorithm, called iterative clustering projection (ICP), that uses logistic regression and clustering similarity comparison to iteratively cluster data. Remarkably, ICP also manages to integrate feature selection with the clustering through L1-regularization, enabling the identification of genes that are differentially expressed between cell populations. By combining solutions of multiple ICP runs into a single consensus solution, ILoReg creates a representation that enables investigating cell populations with a high resolution. In particular, we show that the visualization of ILoReg allows segregation of immune and pancreatic cell populations in a more pronounced manner compared with current state-of-the-art methods. ILoReg is available as an R package at https://bioconductor.org/packages/ILoReg. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	287	0.785763175906913	4	26	1	0.003484320557491289	4.5

With increasingly large scRNAseq datasets, unsupervised clustering methods can now produce detailed catalogues of transcriptionally distinct groups of cells in a sample. However, the interpretation of these clusters is challenging for both technical and biological reasons. Popular clustering algorithms are sensitive to parameter choices, and can produce different clustering solutions with even small changes in the number of principal components used, the k nearest neighbor and the resolution parameters, among others. Here, we present a set of tools to evaluate cluster stability by subsampling, which can guide parameter choice and aid in biological interpretation. The R package scclusteval and the accompanying Snakemake workflow implement all steps of the pipeline: subsampling the cells, repeating the clustering with Seurat and estimation of cluster stability using the Jaccard similarity index and providing rich visualizations.

A key challenge in the estimation of single-cell potency is the need for a fast and accurate algorithm, scalable to large scRNA-Seq studies profiling millions of cells. Here, we present a single-cell potency measure, called Correlation of Connectome and Transcriptome (CCAT), which can return accurate single-cell potency estimates of a million cells in minutes, a 100-fold improvement over current state-of-the-art methods. We benchmark CCAT against 8 other single-cell potency models and across 28 scRNA-Seq studies, encompassing over 2 million cells, demonstrating comparable accuracy than the current state-of-the-art, at a significantly reduced computational cost, and with increased robustness to dropouts.

Specifically, the investigation of condition-specific functional gene modules (FGM) can help to understand interactive gene networks and complex biological processes in different cell clusters. QUBIC2 is recognized as one of the most efficient and effective biclustering tools for condition-specific FGM identification from scRNA-Seq data. However, its limited availability to a C implementation restricted its application to only a few downstream analysis functionalities. We developed an R package named IRIS-FGM (Integrative scRNA-Seq Interpretation System for Functional Gene Module analysis) to support the investigation of FGMs and cell clustering using scRNA-Seq data. Empowered by QUBIC2, IRIS-FGM can effectively identify condition-specific FGMs, predict cell types/clusters, uncover differentially expressed genes and perform pathway enrichment analysis. It is noteworthy that IRIS-FGM can also take Seurat objects as input, facilitating easy integration with the existing analysis pipeline.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btab116	FALSE	FALSE	ESCO: single cell expression simulation incorporating gene co-expression	2021-02-24	Gene-gene co-expression networks (GCN) are of biological interest for the useful information they provide for understanding gene-gene interactions. The advent of single cell RNA-sequencing allows us to examine more subtle gene co-expression occurring within a cell type. Many imputation and denoising methods have been developed to deal with the technical challenges observed in single cell data; meanwhile, several simulators have been developed for benchmarking and assessing these methods. Most of these simulators, however, either do not incorporate gene co-expression or generate co-expression in an inconvenient manner. Therefore, with the focus on gene co-expression, we propose a new simulator, ESCO, which adopts the idea of the copula to impose gene co-expression, while preserving the highlights of available simulators, which perform well for simulation of gene expression marginally. Using ESCO, we assess the performance of imputation methods on GCN recovery and find that imputation generally helps GCN recovery when the data are not too sparse, and the ensemble imputation method works best among leading methods. In contrast, imputation fails to help in the presence of an excessive fraction of zero counts, where simple data aggregating methods are a better choice. These findings are further verified with mouse and human brain cell data. The ESCO implementation is available as R package ESCO. Users can either download the development version via github (https://github.com/JINJINT/ESCO) or the archived version via Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/4455890).

10.1093/bioinformatics/btab167	FALSE	FALSE	DCI: learning causal differences between gene regulatory networks	2021-03-11	Designing interventions to control gene regulation necessitates modeling a gene regulatory network by a causal graph. Currently, large-scale gene expression datasets from different conditions, cell types, disease states, and developmental time points are being collected. However, application of classical causal inference algorithms to infer gene regulatory networks based on such data is still challenging, requiring high sample sizes and computational resources. Here, we describe an algorithm that efficiently learns the differences in gene regulatory mechanisms between different conditions. Our difference causal inference (DCI) algorithm infers changes (i.e. edges that appeared, disappeared, or changed weight) between two causal graphs given gene expression data from the two conditions. This algorithm is efficient in its use of samples and computation since it infers the differences between causal graphs directly without estimating each possibly large causal graph separately. We provide a user-friendly Python implementation of DCI and also enable the user to learn the most robust difference causal graph across different tuning parameters via stability selection. Finally, we show how to apply DCI to single-cell RNA-seq data from different conditions and cell states, and we also validate our algorithm by predicting the effects of interventions.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btab209	FALSE	FALSE	ShinyCell: simple and sharable visualization of single-cell gene expression data	2021-03-28	As the generation of complex single-cell RNA sequencing datasets becomes more commonplace it is the responsibility of researchers to provide access to these data in a way that can be easily explored and shared. Whilst it is often the case that data is deposited for future bioinformatic analysis many studies do not release their data in a way that is easy to explore by non-computational researchers. In order to help address this we have developed ShinyCell, an R package that converts single-cell RNA sequencing datasets into explorable and shareable interactive interfaces. These interfaces can be easily customized in order to maximize their usability and can be easily uploaded to online platforms to facilitate wider access to published data. ShinyCell is available at https://github.com/SGDDNB/ShinyCell and https://figshare.com/projects/ShinyCell/100439.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btab226	FALSE	FALSE	Fast identification of differential distributions in single-cell RNA-sequencing data with waddR	2021-04-01	Single-cell gene expression distributions measured by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) often display complex differences between samples. These differences are biologically meaningful but cannot be identified using standard methods for differential expression. Here, we derive and implement a flexible and fast differential distribution testing procedure based on the 2-Wasserstein distance. Our method is able to detect any type of difference in distribution between conditions. To interpret distributional differences, we decompose the 2-Wasserstein distance into terms that capture the relative contribution of changes in mean, variance and shape to the overall difference. Finally, we derive mathematical generalizations that allow our method to be used in a broad range of disciplines other than scRNA-seq or bioinformatics. Our methods are implemented in the R/Bioconductor package waddR, which is freely available at https://github.com/goncalves-lab/waddR, along with documentation and examples.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btab239	FALSE	FALSE	MicroCellClust: mining rare and highly specific subpopulations from single-cell expression data	2021-04-08	Identifying rare subpopulations of cells is a critical step in order to extract knowledge from single-cell expression data, especially when the available data is limited and rare subpopulations only contain a few cells. In this paper, we present a data mining method to identify small subpopulations of cells that present highly specific expression profiles. This objective is formalized as a constrained optimization problem that jointly identifies a small group of cells and a corresponding subset of specific genes. The proposed method extends the max-sum submatrix problem to yield genes that are, for instance, highly expressed inside a small number of cells, but have a low expression in the remaining ones. We show through controlled experiments on scRNA-seq data that the MicroCellClust method achieves a high F1 score to identify rare subpopulations of artificially planted human T cells. The effectiveness of MicroCellClust is confirmed as it reveals a subpopulation of CD4 T cells with a specific phenotype from breast cancer samples, and a subpopulation linked to a specific stage in the cell cycle from breast cancer samples as well. Finally, three rare subpopulations in mouse embryonic stem cells are also identified with MicroCellClust. These results illustrate the proposed method outperforms typical alternatives at identifying small subsets of cells with highly specific expression profiles. The R and Scala implementation of MicroCellClust is freely available on GitHub, at https://github.com/agerniers/MicroCellClust/ The data underlying this article are available on Zenodo, at https://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4580332.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btab245	FALSE	FALSE	scConnect: a method for exploratory analysis of cell-cell communication based on single cell RNA sequencing data	2021-05-11	Cell to cell communication is critical for all multicellular organisms, and single-cell sequencing facilitates the construction of full connectivity graphs between cell types in tissues. Such complex data structures demand novel analysis methods and tools for exploratory analysis. We propose a method to predict the putative ligand–receptor interactions between cell types from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. This is achieved by inferring and incorporating interactions in a multi-directional graph, thereby enabling contextual exploratory analysis. We demonstrate that our approach can detect common and specific interactions between cell types in mouse brain and human tumors, and that these interactions fit with expected outcomes. These interactions also include predictions made with molecular ligands integrating information from several types of genes necessary for ligand production and transport. Our implementation is general and can be appended to any transcriptome analysis pipeline to provide unbiased hypothesis generation regarding ligand to receptor interactions between cell populations or for network analysis in silico. scConnect is open source and available as a Python package at https://github.com/JonETJakobsson/scConnect. scConnect is directly compatible with Scanpy scRNA-sequencing pipelines.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btab250	FALSE	FALSE	MAT2: Manifold alignment of single-cell transcriptomes with cell triplets	2021-05-10	Aligning single-cell transcriptomes is important for the joint analysis of multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, which in turn is vital to establishing a holistic cellular landscape of certain biological processes. Although numbers of approaches have been proposed for this problem, most of which only consider mutual neighbors when aligning the cells without taking into account known cell type annotations. In this work, we present MAT2 that aligns cells in the manifold space with a deep neural network employing contrastive learning strategy. Compared with other manifold-based approaches, MAT2 has two-fold advantages. Firstly, with cell triplets defined based on known cell type annotations, the consensus manifold yielded by the alignment procedure is more robust especially for datasets with limited common cell types. Secondly, the batch-effect-free gene expression reconstructed by MAT2 can better help annotate cell types. Benchmarking results on real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that MAT2 outperforms existing popular methods. Moreover, with MAT2, the hematopoietic stem cells are found to differentiate at different paces between human and mouse. MAT2 is publicly available at https://github.com/Zhang-Jinglong/MAT2.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btab260	FALSE	FALSE	RVAgene: Generative modeling of gene expression time series data	2021-05-11	Methods to model dynamic changes in gene expression at a genome-wide level are not currently sufficient for large (temporally rich or single-cell) datasets. Variational autoencoders offer means to characterize large datasets and have been used effectively to characterize features of single-cell datasets. Here, we extend these methods for use with gene expression time series data. We present RVAgene: a recurrent variational autoencoder to model gene expression dynamics. RVAgene learns to accurately and efficiently reconstruct temporal gene profiles. It also learns a low dimensional representation of the data via a recurrent encoder network that can be used for biological feature discovery, and from which we can generate new gene expression data by sampling the latent space. We test RVAgene on simulated and real biological datasets, including embryonic stem cell differentiation and kidney injury response dynamics. In all cases, RVAgene accurately reconstructed complex gene expression temporal profiles. Via cross validation, we show that a low-error latent space representation can be learnt using only a fraction of the data. Through clustering and gene ontology term enrichment analysis on the latent space, we demonstrate the potential of RVAgene for unsupervised discovery. In particular, RVAgene identifies new programs of shared gene regulation of Lox family genes in response to kidney injury. All datasets analyzed in this manuscript are publicly available and have been published previously. RVAgene is available in Python, at GitHub: https://github.com/maclean-lab/RVAgene; Zenodo archive: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4271097.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btab269	FALSE	FALSE	Bayesian information sharing enhances detection of regulatory associations in rare cell types	2021-07-12	Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies promise to enable the study of gene regulatory associations at unprecedented resolution in diverse cellular contexts. However, identifying unique regulatory associations observed only in specific cell types or conditions remains a key challenge; this is particularly so for rare transcriptional states whose sample sizes are too small for existing gene regulatory network inference methods to be effective. We present ShareNet, a Bayesian framework for boosting the accuracy of cell type-specific gene regulatory networks by propagating information across related cell types via an information sharing structure that is adaptively optimized for a given single-cell dataset. The techniques we introduce can be used with a range of general network inference algorithms to enhance the output for each cell type. We demonstrate the enhanced accuracy of our approach on three benchmark scRNA-seq datasets. We find that our inferred cell type-specific networks also uncover key changes in gene associations that underpin the complex rewiring of regulatory networks across cell types, tissues and dynamic biological processes. Our work presents a path toward extracting deeper insights about cell type-specific gene regulation in the rapidly growing compendium of scRNA-seq datasets. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btab273	FALSE	FALSE	scPNMF: sparse gene encoding of single cells to facilitate gene selection for targeted gene profiling	2021-07-12	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) captures whole transcriptome information of individual cells. While scRNA-seq measures thousands of genes, researchers are often interested in only dozens to hundreds of genes for a closer study. Then, a question is how to select those informative genes from scRNA-seq data. Moreover, single-cell targeted gene profiling technologies are gaining popularity for their low costs, high sensitivity and extra (e.g. spatial) information; however, they typically can only measure up to a few hundred genes. Then another challenging question is how to select genes for targeted gene profiling based on existing scRNA-seq data. Here, we develop the single-cell Projective Non-negative Matrix Factorization (scPNMF) method to select informative genes from scRNA-seq data in an unsupervised way. Compared with existing gene selection methods, scPNMF has two advantages. First, its selected informative genes can better distinguish cell types. Second, it enables the alignment of new targeted gene profiling data with reference data in a low-dimensional space to facilitate the prediction of cell types in the new data. Technically, scPNMF modifies the PNMF algorithm for gene selection by changing the initialization and adding a basis selection step, which selects informative bases to distinguish cell types. We demonstrate that scPNMF outperforms the state-of-the-art gene selection methods on diverse scRNA-seq datasets. Moreover, we show that scPNMF can guide the design of targeted gene profiling experiments and the cell-type annotation on targeted gene profiling data. The R package is open-access and available at https://github.com/JSB-UCLA/scPNMF. The data used in this work are available at Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4797997.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btab276	FALSE	FALSE	Clustering single-cell RNA-seq data by rank constrained similarity learning	2021-05-07	Recent breakthroughs of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies offer an exciting opportunity to identify heterogeneous cell types in complex tissues. However, the unavoidable biological noise and technical artifacts in scRNA-seq data as well as the high dimensionality of expression vectors make the problem highly challenging. Consequently, although numerous tools have been developed, their accuracy remains to be improved. Here, we introduce a novel clustering algorithm and tool RCSL (Rank Constrained Similarity Learning) to accurately identify various cell types using scRNA-seq data from a complex tissue. RCSL considers both local similarity and global similarity among the cells to discern the subtle differences among cells of the same type as well as larger differences among cells of different types. RCSL uses Spearman’s rank correlations of a cell’s expression vector with those of other cells to measure its global similarity, and adaptively learns neighbor representation of a cell as its local similarity. The overall similarity of a cell to other cells is a linear combination of its global similarity and local similarity. RCSL automatically estimates the number of cell types defined in the similarity matrix, and identifies them by constructing a block-diagonal matrix, such that its distance to the similarity matrix is minimized. Each block-diagonal submatrix is a cell cluster/type, corresponding to a connected component in the cognate similarity graph. When tested on 16 benchmark scRNA-seq datasets in which the cell types are well-annotated, RCSL substantially outperformed six state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness as measured by three metrics. The RCSL algorithm is implemented in R and can be freely downloaded at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCSL/index.html.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btab337	FALSE	FALSE	Differential gene expression analysis for multi-subject single cell RNA sequencing studies with aggregateBioVar	2021-05-10	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides more granular biological information than bulk RNA-sequencing; bulk RNA sequencing remains popular due to lower costs which allows processing more biological replicates and design more powerful studies. As scRNA-seq costs have decreased, collecting data from more than one biological replicate has become more feasible, but careful modeling of different layers of biological variation remains challenging for many users. Here, we propose a statistical model for scRNA-seq gene counts, describe a simple method for estimating model parameters and show that failing to account for additional biological variation in scRNA-seq studies can inflate false discovery rates (FDRs) of statistical tests. First, in a simulation study, we show that when the gene expression distribution of a population of cells varies between subjects, a naïve approach to differential expression analysis will inflate the FDR. We then compare multiple differential expression testing methods on scRNA-seq datasets from human samples and from animal models. These analyses suggest that a naïve approach to differential expression testing could lead to many false discoveries; in contrast, an approach based on pseudobulk counts has better FDR control. A software package, aggregateBioVar, is freely available on Bioconductor (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/aggregateBioVar.html) to accommodate compatibility with upstream and downstream methods in scRNA-seq data analysis pipelines.

However, genotyping methods developed for bulk sequencing data have not been well adapted for single-cell data, in terms of both computational parallelization and simplified user interface. Here we introduce a software, cellsnp-lite, implemented in C/C ++ and based on well-supported package htslib, for genotyping in single-cell sequencing data for both droplet and well based platforms. On various experimental data sets, it shows substantial improvement in computational speed and memory efficiency with retaining highly concordant results compared to existing methods.

Still, however, accurate inference of trajectory is challenging. Recent development of RNA velocity provides an approach to visualize cell state transition without relying on prior knowledge. To perform TI and group cells based on RNA velocity we developed VeTra. By applying cosine similarity and merging weakly connected components, VeTra identifies cell groups from the direction of cell transition. Besides, VeTra suggests key regulators from the inferred trajectory. VeTra is a useful tool for TI and subsequent analysis. The Vetra is available at https://github.com/wgzgithub/VeTra.

However, current methods typically provide a list of inferred LR interactions and do not allow the researcher to focus on specific cell types, ligands or receptors. In addition, most of these methods cannot quantify changes in crosstalk between two biological phenotypes. CrossTalkeR is a framework for network analysis and visualization of LR interactions. CrossTalkeR identifies relevant ligands, receptors and cell types contributing to changes in cell communication when contrasting two biological phenotypes, i.e. disease versus homeostasis. A case study on scRNA-seq of human myeloproliferative neoplasms reinforces the strengths of CrossTalkeR for characterization of changes in cellular crosstalk in disease.

Recent experimental strategies extend scRNA-Seq readouts to include additional features, including cell surface proteins and genomic perturbations. These ‘feature barcoding’ strategies rely on converting molecular and cellular features to unique sequence barcodes, which are then detected with the transcriptome.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btab385	FALSE	FALSE	powerEQTL: an R package and shiny application for sample size and power calculation of bulk tissue and single-cell eQTL analysis	2021-05-19	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed thousands of genetic loci for common diseases. One of the main challenges in the post-GWAS era is to understand the causality of the genetic variants. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis is an effective way to address this question by examining the relationship between gene expression and genetic variation in a sufficiently powered cohort. However, it is frequently a challenge to determine the sample size at which a variant with a specific allele frequency will be detected to associate with gene expression with sufficient power. This is a particularly difficult task for single-cell RNAseq studies. Therefore, a user-friendly tool to estimate statistical power for eQTL analyses in both bulk tissue and single-cell data is needed. Here, we presented an R package called powerEQTL with flexible functions to estimate power, minimal sample size or detectable minor allele frequency for both bulk tissue and single-cell eQTL analysis. A user-friendly, program-free web application is also provided, allowing users to calculate and visualize the parameters interactively.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btab410	FALSE	FALSE	scDetect: a rank-based ensemble learning algorithm for cell type identification of single-cell RNA sequencing in cancer	2021-05-28	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled the characterization of different cell types in many tissues and tumor samples. Cell type identification is essential for single-cell RNA profiling, currently transforming the life sciences. Often, this is achieved by searching for combinations of genes that have previously been implicated as being cell-type specific, an approach that is not quantitative and does not explicitly take advantage of other scRNA-seq studies. Batch effects and different data platforms greatly decrease the predictive performance in inter-laboratory and different data type validation. Here, we present a new ensemble learning method named as ‘scDetect’ that combines gene expression rank-based analysis and a majority vote ensemble machine-learning probability-based prediction method capable of highly accurate classification of cells based on scRNA-seq data by different sequencing platforms. Because of tumor heterogeneity, in order to accurately predict tumor cells in the single-cell RNA-seq data, we have also incorporated cell copy number variation consensus clustering and epithelial score in the classification. We applied scDetect to scRNA-seq data from pancreatic tissue, mononuclear cells and tumor biopsies cells and show that scDetect classified individual cells with high accuracy and better than other publicly available tools. scDetect is an open source software. Source code and test data is freely available from Github (https://github.com/IVDgenomicslab/scDetect/) and Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/4764132#.YKCOlrH5AYN).

Most existing single-cell clustering methods output a fixed number of clusters without the hierarchical information. Classical hierarchical clustering (HC) provides dendrograms of cells, but cannot scale to large datasets due to high computational complexity. We present HGC, a fast Hierarchical Graph-based Clustering tool to address both problems. It combines the advantages of graph-based clustering and HC. On the shared nearest-neighbor graph of cells, HGC constructs the hierarchical tree with linear time complexity. Experiments showed that HGC enables multiresolution exploration of the biological hierarchy underlying the data, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmark data and can scale to large datasets.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btab426	FALSE	FALSE	scAMACE: Model-based approach to the joint analysis of single-cell data on chromatin accessibility, gene expression and methylation	2021-06-04	The advancement in technologies and the growth of available single-cell datasets motivate integrative analysis of multiple single-cell genomic datasets. Integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell datasets combines complementary information offered by single-omic datasets and can offer deeper insights on complex biological process. Clustering methods that identify the unknown cell types are among the first few steps in the analysis of single-cell datasets, and they are important for downstream analysis built upon the identified cell types. We propose scAMACE for the integrative analysis and clustering of single-cell data on chromatin accessibility, gene expression and methylation. We demonstrate that cell types are better identified and characterized through analyzing the three data types jointly. We develop an efficient Expectation–Maximization algorithm to perform statistical inference, and evaluate our methods on both simulation study and real data applications. We also provide the GPU implementation of scAMACE, making it scalable to large datasets.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btab450	FALSE	FALSE	Normalization by distributional resampling of high throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing data	2021-06-19	Normalization to remove technical or experimental artifacts is critical in the analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments, even those for which unique molecular identifiers are available. The majority of methods for normalizing single-cell RNA-sequencing data adjust average expression for library size (LS), allowing the variance and other properties of the gene-specific expression distribution to be non-constant in LS. This often results in reduced power and increased false discoveries in downstream analyses, a problem which is exacerbated by the high proportion of zeros present in most datasets. To address this, we present Dino, a normalization method based on a flexible negative-binomial mixture model of gene expression. As demonstrated in both simulated and case study datasets, by normalizing the entire gene expression distribution, Dino is robust to shallow sequencing, sample heterogeneity and varying zero proportions, leading to improved performance in downstream analyses in a number of settings. The R package, Dino, is available on GitHub at https://github.com/JBrownBiostat/Dino. The Dino package is further archived and freely available on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4897558.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btab486	FALSE	FALSE	Non-parametric modelling of temporal and spatial counts data from RNA-seq experiments	2021-07-02	The negative binomial distribution has been shown to be a good model for counts data from both bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a useful non-parametric approach for modelling temporal or spatial changes in gene expression. However, currently available GP regression methods that implement negative binomial likelihood models do not scale to the increasingly large datasets being produced by single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. The GPcounts package implements GP regression methods for modelling counts data using a negative binomial likelihood function. Computational efficiency is achieved through the use of variational Bayesian inference. The GP function models changes in the mean of the negative binomial likelihood through a logarithmic link function and the dispersion parameter is fitted by maximum likelihood. We validate the method on simulated time course data, showing better performance to identify changes in over-dispersed counts data than methods based on Gaussian or Poisson likelihoods. To demonstrate temporal inference, we apply GPcounts to single-cell RNA-seq datasets after pseudotime and branching inference. To demonstrate spatial inference, we apply GPcounts to data from the mouse olfactory bulb to identify spatially variable genes and compare to two published GP methods. We also provide the option of modelling additional dropout using a zero-inflated negative binomial. Our results show that GPcounts can be used to model temporal and spatial counts data in cases where simpler Gaussian and Poisson likelihoods are unrealistic. GPcounts is implemented using the GPflow library in Python and is available at https://github.com/ManchesterBioinference/GPcounts along with the data, code and notebooks required to reproduce the results presented here.

However, most existing trajectory methods are specifically designed for individual cells, so they can hardly meet the needs of accurately inferring the trajectory topology of the cell state, which usually contains cells assigned to different branches. Here, we present CStreet, a computed Cell State trajectory inference method for time-series scRNA-seq data. It uses time-series information to construct the k-nearest neighbor connections between cells within each time point and between adjacent time points. Then, CStreet estimates the connection probabilities of the cell states and visualizes the trajectory, which may include multiple starting points and paths, using a force-directed graph. By comparing the performance of CStreet with that of six commonly used cell state trajectory reconstruction methods on simulated data and real data, we demonstrate the high accuracy and high tolerance of CStreet. CStreet is written in Python and freely available on the web at https://github.com/TongjiZhanglab/CStreet and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4483205 Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	87	0.23819301848049282	5	29	0	0	8.83

10.1093/bioinformatics/btab521	FALSE	FALSE	FlowGrid enables fast clustering of very large single-cell RNA-seq data	2021-07-21	Scalable clustering algorithms are needed to analyze millions of cells in single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. Here, we present an open source python package called FlowGrid that can integrate into the Scanpy workflow to perform clustering on very large scRNA-seq datasets. FlowGrid implements a fast density-based clustering algorithm originally designed for flow cytometry data analysis. We introduce a new automated parameter tuning procedure, and show that FlowGrid can achieve comparable clustering accuracy as state-of-the-art clustering algorithms but at a substantially reduced run time for very large single cell RNA-seq datasets. For example, FlowGrid can complete a one-hour clustering task for one million cells in about five min. https://github.com/holab-hku/FlowGrid.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btab594	FALSE	FALSE	Manifold alignment for heterogeneous single-cell multi-omics data integration using Pamona	2021-08-16	Single-cell multi-omics sequencing data can provide a comprehensive molecular view of cells. However, effective approaches for the integrative analysis of such data are challenging. Existing manifold alignment methods demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance on single-cell multi-omics data integration, but they are often limited by requiring that single-cell datasets be derived from the same underlying cellular structure. In this study, we present Pamona, a partial Gromov-Wasserstein distance-based manifold alignment framework that integrates heterogeneous single-cell multi-omics datasets with the aim of delineating and representing the shared and dataset-specific cellular structures across modalities. We formulate this task as a partial manifold alignment problem and develop a partial Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport framework to solve it. Pamona identifies both shared and dataset-specific cells based on the computed probabilistic couplings of cells across datasets, and it aligns cellular modalities in a common low-dimensional space, while simultaneously preserving both shared and dataset-specific structures. Our framework can easily incorporate prior information, such as cell type annotations or cell-cell correspondence, to further improve alignment quality. We evaluated Pamona on a comprehensive set of publicly available benchmark datasets. We demonstrated that Pamona can accurately identify shared and dataset-specific cells, as well as faithfully recover and align cellular structures of heterogeneous single-cell modalities in a common space, outperforming the comparable existing methods. Pamona software is available at https://github.com/caokai1073/Pamona. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	41	0.11225188227241616	3	41	1	0.024390243902439025	0.5
10.1093/bioinformatics/btab641	FALSE	FALSE	PsiNorm: a scalable normalization for single-cell RNA-seq data	2021-09-09	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables transcriptome-wide gene expression measurements at single-cell resolution providing a comprehensive view of the compositions and dynamics of tissue and organism development. The evolution of scRNA-seq protocols has led to a dramatic increase of cells throughput, exacerbating many of the computational and statistical issues that previously arose for bulk sequencing. In particular, with scRNA-seq data all the analyses steps, including normalization, have become computationally intensive, both in terms of memory usage and computational time. In this perspective, new accurate methods able to scale efficiently are desirable. Here, we propose PsiNorm, a between-sample normalization method based on the power-law Pareto distribution parameter estimate. Here, we show that the Pareto distribution well resembles scRNA-seq data, especially those coming from platforms that use unique molecular identifiers. Motivated by this result, we implement PsiNorm, a simple and highly scalable normalization method. We benchmark PsiNorm against seven other methods in terms of cluster identification, concordance and computational resources required. We demonstrate that PsiNorm is among the top performing methods showing a good trade-off between accuracy and scalability. Moreover, PsiNorm does not need a reference, a characteristic that makes it useful in supervised classification settings, in which new out-of-sample data need to be normalized. PsiNorm is implemented in the scone Bioconductor package and available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/scone/.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btab653	FALSE	FALSE	VeloViz: RNA velocity informed embeddings for visualizing cellular trajectories	2021-09-10	Single cell transcriptomics profiling technologies enable genome-wide gene expression measurements in individual cells but can currently only provide a static snapshot of cellular transcriptional states. RNA velocity analysis can help infer cell state changes using such single cell transcriptomics data. To interpret these cell state changes inferred from RNA velocity as part of underlying cellular trajectories, current approaches rely on visualization with principal components, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, and other 2D embeddings derived from the observed single cell transcriptional states. However, these 2D embeddings can yield different representations of the underlying cellular trajectories, hindering the interpretation of cell state changes. We developed VeloViz to create RNA-velocity-informed 2D and 3D embeddings from single cell transcriptomics data. Using both real and simulated data, we demonstrate that VeloViz embeddings are able to capture underlying cellular trajectories across diverse trajectory topologies, even when intermediate cell states may be missing. By taking into consideration the predicted future transcriptional states from RNA velocity analysis, VeloViz can help visualize a more reliable representation of underlying cellular trajectories.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btw176	FALSE	FALSE	Quality control of single-cell RNA-seq by SinQC	2016-04-10	Summary: Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is emerging as a promising technology for profiling cell-to-cell variability in cell populations. However, the combination of technical noise and intrinsic biological variability makes detecting technical artifacts in scRNA-seq samples particularly challenging. Proper detection of technical artifacts is critical to prevent spurious results during downstream analysis. In this study, we present ‘Single-cell RNA-seq Quality Control’ (SinQC), a method and software tool to detect technical artifacts in scRNA-seq samples by integrating both gene expression patterns and data quality information. We apply SinQC to nine different scRNA-seq datasets, and show that SinQC is a useful tool for controlling scRNA-seq data quality.

Robust inference of cell state transition paths and probabilities is an important yet challenging step in the analysis of these data. Here we present scEpath, an algorithm that calculates energy landscapes and probabilistic directed graphs in order to reconstruct developmental trajectories. We quantify the energy landscape using ‘single-cell energy’ and distance-based measures, and find that the combination of these enables robust inference of the transition probabilities and lineage relationships between cell states. We also identify marker genes and gene expression patterns associated with cell state transitions. Our approach produces pseudotemporal orderings that are—in combination—more robust and accurate than current methods, and offers higher resolution dynamics of the cell state transitions, leading to new insight into key transition events during differentiation and development. Moreover, scEpath is robust to variation in the size of the input gene set, and is broadly unsupervised, requiring few parameters to be set by the user. Applications of scEpath led to the identification of a cell-cell communication network implicated in early human embryo development, and novel transcription factors important for myoblast differentiation. scEpath allows us to identify common and specific temporal dynamics and transcriptional factor programs along branched lineages, as well as the transition probabilities that control cell fates. A MATLAB package of scEpath is available at https://github.com/sqjin/scEpath. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	1329	3.6386036960985626	4	41	39	0.029345372460496615	11.08

10.1093/bioinformatics/bty1009	FALSE	FALSE	DensityPath: an algorithm to visualize and reconstruct cell state-transition path on density landscape for single-cell RNA sequencing data	2018-12-07	Visualizing and reconstructing cell developmental trajectories intrinsically embedded in high-dimensional expression profiles of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) snapshot data are computationally intriguing, but challenging. We propose DensityPath, an algorithm allowing (i) visualization of the intrinsic structure of scRNA-seq data on an embedded 2-d space and (ii) reconstruction of an optimal cell state-transition path on the density landscape. DensityPath powerfully handles high dimensionality and heterogeneity of scRNA-seq data by (i) revealing the intrinsic structures of data, while adopting a non-linear dimension reduction algorithm, termed elastic embedding, which can preserve both local and global structures of the data; and (ii) extracting the topological features of high-density, level-set clusters from a single-cell multimodal density landscape of transcriptional heterogeneity, as the representative cell states. DensityPath reconstructs the optimal cell state-transition path by finding the geodesic minimum spanning tree of representative cell states on the density landscape, establishing a least action path with the minimum-transition-energy of cell fate decisions. We demonstrate that DensityPath can ably reconstruct complex trajectories of cell development, e.g. those with multiple bifurcating and trifurcating branches, while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, DensityPath has high accuracy for pseudotime calculation and branch assignment on real scRNA-seq, as well as simulated datasets. DensityPath is robust to parameter choices, as well as permutations of data. DensityPath software is available at https://github.com/ucasdp/DensityPath.

10.1093/bioinformatics/bty1016	FALSE	FALSE	Optimal Gene Filtering for Single-Cell data (OGFSC)—a gene filtering algorithm for single-cell RNA-seq data	2018-12-10	Single-cell transcriptomic data are commonly accompanied by extremely high technical noise due to the low RNA concentrations from individual cells. Precise identification of differentially expressed genes and cell populations are heavily dependent on the effective reduction of technical noise, e.g. by gene filtering. However, there is still no well-established standard in the current approaches of gene filtering. Investigators usually filter out genes based on single fixed threshold, which commonly leads to both over- and under-stringent errors. In this study, we propose a novel algorithm, termed as Optimal Gene Filtering for Single-Cell data, to construct a thresholding curve based on gene expression levels and the corresponding variances. We validated our method on multiple single-cell RNA-seq datasets, including simulated and published experimental datasets. The results show that the known signal and known noise are reliably discriminated in the simulated datasets. In addition, the results of seven experimental datasets demonstrate that these cells of the same annotated types are more sharply clustered using our method. Interestingly, when we re-analyze the dataset from an aging research recently published in Science, we find a list of regulated genes which is different from that reported in the original study, because of using different filtering methods. However, the knowledge based on our findings better matches the progression of immunosenescence. In summary, we here provide an alternative opportunity to probe into the true level of technical noise in single-cell transcriptomic data. https://github.com/XZouProjects/OGFSC.git Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	1021	2.7953456536618755	5	25	4	0.0039177277179236044	24.28
10.1093/bioinformatics/bty1044	FALSE	FALSE	M3Drop: dropout-based feature selection for scRNASeq	2018-12-24	Most genomes contain thousands of genes, but for most functional responses, only a subset of those genes are relevant. To facilitate many single-cell RNASeq (scRNASeq) analyses the set of genes is often reduced through feature selection, i.e. by removing genes only subject to technical noise. We present M3Drop, an R package that implements popular existing feature selection methods and two novel methods which take advantage of the prevalence of zeros (dropouts) in scRNASeq data to identify features. We show these new methods outperform existing methods on simulated and real datasets. M3Drop is freely available on github as an R package and is compatible with other popular scRNASeq tools: https://github.com/tallulandrews/M3Drop.

10.1093/bioinformatics/bty1056	FALSE	FALSE	Single-cell RNA-seq interpretations using evolutionary multiobjective ensemble pruning	2018-12-28	In recent years, single-cell RNA sequencing enables us to discover cell types or even subtypes. Its increasing availability provides opportunities to identify cell populations from single-cell RNA-seq data. Computational methods have been employed to reveal the gene expression variations among multiple cell populations. Unfortunately, the existing ones can suffer from realistic restrictions such as experimental noises, numerical instability, high dimensionality and computational scalability. We propose an evolutionary multiobjective ensemble pruning algorithm (EMEP) that addresses those realistic restrictions. Our EMEP algorithm first applies the unsupervised dimensionality reduction to project data from the original high dimensions to low-dimensional subspaces; basic clustering algorithms are applied in those new subspaces to generate different clustering results to form cluster ensembles. However, most of those cluster ensembles are unnecessarily bulky with the expense of extra time costs and memory consumption. To overcome that problem, EMEP is designed to dynamically select the suitable clustering results from the ensembles. Moreover, to guide the multiobjective ensemble evolution, three cluster validity indices including the overall cluster deviation, the within-cluster compactness and the number of basic partition clusters are formulated as the objective functions to unleash its cell type discovery performance using evolutionary multiobjective optimization. We applied EMEP to 55 simulated datasets and seven real single-cell RNA-seq datasets, including six single-cell RNA-seq dataset and one large-scale dataset with 3005 cells and 4412 genes. Two case studies are also conducted to reveal mechanistic insights into the biological relevance of EMEP. We found that EMEP can achieve superior performance over the other clustering algorithms, demonstrating that EMEP can identify cell populations clearly. EMEP is written in Matlab and available at https://github.com/lixt314/EMEP Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	1003	2.746064339493498	3	42	5	0.004985044865403789	16.026

However, the application of scRNA-seq to clinical cancer samples has been limited, partly due to a lack of scRNA-seq algorithms that integrate genomic mutation data. To address this, we present COpy-Number analysis In single-Cell RNA-Sequencing. CONICS is a software tool for mapping gene expression from scRNA-seq to tumor clones and phylogenies, with routines enabling: the quantitation of copy-number alterations in scRNA-seq, robust separation of neoplastic cells from tumor-infiltrating stroma, inter-clone differential-expression analysis and intra-clone co-expression analysis.

While state-of-the-art clustering methods have been applied to the data, they face challenges in the following aspects: (i) the clustering quality still needs to be improved; (ii) most models need prior knowledge on number of clusters, which is not always available; (iii) there is a demand for faster computational speed. We propose to tackle these challenges with Parallelized Split Merge Sampling on Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (the Para-DPMM model). Unlike classic DPMM methods that perform sampling on each single data point, the split merge mechanism samples on the cluster level, which significantly improves convergence and optimality of the result. The model is highly parallelized and can utilize the computing power of high performance computing (HPC) clusters, enabling massive inference on huge datasets. Experiment results show the model outperforms current widely used models in both clustering quality and computational speed.

Multidimensional data sparsity, zero inflation and technical variation necessitate the selection of high-quality features that feed downstream analyses. Despite the development of numerous algorithms for the unsupervised selection of biologically relevant features, their differential performance remains largely unaddressed. We implemented the neighborhood variance ratio (NVR) feature selection approach as a Python package with substantial improvements in performance. In comparing NVR with multiple unsupervised algorithms such as dpFeature, we observed striking differences in features selected. We present evidence that quantifiable dataset properties have observable and predictable effects on the performance of these algorithms. pyNVR is freely available at https://github.com/KenLauLab/NVR.

Further study of single cell profiles across different conditions enables the understanding of biological processes and underlying mechanisms at the sub-population level. However, developing proper methodology to compare multiple scRNA-Seq datasets remains challenging. We have developed ClusterMap, a systematic method and workflow to facilitate the comparison of scRNA-seq profiles across distinct biological contexts. Using hierarchical clustering of the marker genes of each sub-group, ClusterMap matches the sub-types of cells across different samples and provides ‘similarity’ as a metric to quantify the quality of the match. We introduce a purity tree cut method designed specifically for this matching problem. We use Circos plot and regrouping method to visualize the results concisely. Furthermore, we propose a new metric ‘separability’ to summarize sub-population changes among all sample pairs. In the case studies, we demonstrate that ClusterMap has the ability to provide us further insight into the different molecular mechanisms of cellular sub-populations across different conditions. ClusterMap is implemented in R and available at https://github.com/xgaoo/ClusterMap.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btz095	FALSE	FALSE	Dhaka: variational autoencoder for unmasking tumor heterogeneity from single cell genomic data	2019-02-15	Intra-tumor heterogeneity is one of the key confounding factors in deciphering tumor evolution. Malignant cells exhibit variations in their gene expression, copy numbers and mutation even when originating from a single progenitor cell. Single cell sequencing of tumor cells has recently emerged as a viable option for unmasking the underlying tumor heterogeneity. However, extracting features from single cell genomic data in order to infer their evolutionary trajectory remains computationally challenging due to the extremely noisy and sparse nature of the data. Here we describe ‘Dhaka’, a variational autoencoder method which transforms single cell genomic data to a reduced dimension feature space that is more efficient in differentiating between (hidden) tumor subpopulations. Our method is general and can be applied to several different types of genomic data including copy number variation from scDNA-Seq and gene expression from scRNA-Seq experiments. We tested the method on synthetic and six single cell cancer datasets where the number of cells ranges from 250 to 6000 for each sample. Analysis of the resulting feature space revealed subpopulations of cells and their marker genes. The features are also able to infer the lineage and/or differentiation trajectory between cells greatly improving upon prior methods suggested for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction of such data. All the datasets used in the paper are publicly available and developed software package and supporting info is available on Github https://github.com/MicrosoftGenomics/Dhaka.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btz139	FALSE	FALSE	SinNLRR: a robust subspace clustering method for cell type detection by non-negative and low-rank representation	2019-03-01	The development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a new perspective to study biological problems at the single-cell level. One of the key issues in scRNA-seq analysis is to resolve the heterogeneity and diversity of cells, which is to cluster the cells into several groups. However, many existing clustering methods are designed to analyze bulk RNA-seq data, it is urgent to develop the new scRNA-seq clustering methods. Moreover, the high noise in scRNA-seq data also brings a lot of challenges to computational methods. In this study, we propose a novel scRNA-seq cell type detection method based on similarity learning, called SinNLRR. The method is motivated by the self-expression of the cells with the same group. Specifically, we impose the non-negative and low rank structure on the similarity matrix. We apply alternating direction method of multipliers to solve the optimization problem and propose an adaptive penalty selection method to avoid the sensitivity to the parameters. The learned similarity matrix could be incorporated with spectral clustering, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding for visualization and Laplace score for prioritizing gene markers. In contrast to other scRNA-seq clustering methods, our method achieves more robust and accurate results on different datasets. Our MATLAB implementation of SinNLRR is available at, https://github.com/zrq0123/SinNLRR.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btz177	FALSE	FALSE	Probabilistic count matrix factorization for single cell expression data analysis	2019-03-13	The development of high-throughput single-cell sequencing technologies now allows the investigation of the population diversity of cellular transcriptomes. The expression dynamics (gene-to-gene variability) can be quantified more accurately, thanks to the measurement of lowly expressed genes. In addition, the cell-to-cell variability is high, with a low proportion of cells expressing the same genes at the same time/level. Those emerging patterns appear to be very challenging from the statistical point of view, especially to represent a summarized view of single-cell expression data. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a most powerful tool for high dimensional data representation, by searching for latent directions catching the most variability in the data. Unfortunately, classical PCA is based on Euclidean distance and projections that poorly work in presence of over-dispersed count data with dropout events like single-cell expression data. We propose a probabilistic Count Matrix Factorization (pCMF) approach for single-cell expression data analysis that relies on a sparse Gamma-Poisson factor model. This hierarchical model is inferred using a variational EM algorithm. It is able to jointly build a low dimensional representation of cells and genes. We show how this probabilistic framework induces a geometry that is suitable for single-cell data visualization, and produces a compression of the data that is very powerful for clustering purposes. Our method is competed against other standard representation methods like t-SNE, and we illustrate its performance for the representation of single-cell expression data. Our work is implemented in the pCMF R-package (https://github.com/gdurif/pCMF). Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	928	2.54072553045859	5	51	13	0.014008620689655173	10.08
10.1093/bioinformatics/btz240	FALSE	FALSE	scRNAss: a single-cell RNA-seq assembler via imputing dropouts and combing junctions	2019-04-05	Full-length transcript reconstruction is essential for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis, but dropout events, which can cause transcripts discarded completely or broken into pieces, pose great challenges for transcript assembly. Currently available RNA-seq assemblers are generally designed for bulk RNA sequencing. To fill the gap, we introduce single-cell RNA-seq assembler, a method that applies explicit strategies to impute lost information caused by dropout events and a combing strategy to infer transcripts using scRNA-seq. Extensive evaluations on both simulated and biological datasets demonstrated its superiority over the state-of-the-art RNA-seq assemblers including StringTie, Cufflinks and CLASS2. In particular, it showed a remarkable capability of recovering unknown ‘novel’ isoforms and highly computational efficiency compared to other tools. scRNAss is free, open-source software available from https://sourceforge.net/projects/single-cell-rna-seq-assembly/files/.

The format can be used with all single-cell RNA-seq technologies, and we show that BUS files can be efficiently generated. BUStools is a suite of tools for working with BUS files and facilitates rapid quantification and analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btz288	FALSE	FALSE	Cell-level somatic mutation detection from single-cell RNA sequencing	2019-04-26	Both single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) have been applied for cell-level genomic profiling. For mutation profiling, the latter seems more natural. However, the task is highly challenging due to the limited input materials from only two copies of DNA molecules, while whole-genome amplification generates biases and other technical noises. ScRNA-seq starts with a higher input amount, so generally has better data quality. There exists various methods for mutation detection from DNA sequencing, it is not clear whether these methods work for scRNA-seq data. Mutation detection methods developed for either bulk-cell sequencing data or scDNA-seq data do not work well for the scRNA-seq data, as they produce substantial numbers of false positives. We develop a novel and robust statistical method—called SCmut—to identify specific cells that harbor mutations discovered in bulk-cell data. Statistically SCmut controls the false positives using the 2D local false discovery rate method. We apply SCmut to several scRNA-seq datasets. In scRNA-seq breast cancer datasets SCmut identifies a number of highly confident cell-level mutations that are recurrent in many cells and consistent in different samples. In a scRNA-seq glioblastoma dataset, we discover a recurrent cell-level mutation in the PDGFRA gene that is highly correlated with a well-known in-frame deletion in the gene. To conclude, this study contributes a novel method to discover cell-level mutation information from scRNA-seq that can facilitate investigation of cell-to-cell heterogeneity.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btz292	FALSE	FALSE	scMatch: a single-cell gene expression profile annotation tool using reference datasets	2019-04-26	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) measures gene expression at the resolution of individual cells. Massively multiplexed single-cell profiling has enabled large-scale transcriptional analyses of thousands of cells in complex tissues. In most cases, the true identity of individual cells is unknown and needs to be inferred from the transcriptomic data. Existing methods typically cluster (group) cells based on similarities of their gene expression profiles and assign the same identity to all cells within each cluster using the averaged expression levels. However, scRNA-seq experiments typically produce low-coverage sequencing data for each cell, which hinders the clustering process. We introduce scMatch, which directly annotates single cells by identifying their closest match in large reference datasets. We used this strategy to annotate various single-cell datasets and evaluated the impacts of sequencing depth, similarity metric and reference datasets. We found that scMatch can rapidly and robustly annotate single cells with comparable accuracy to another recent cell annotation tool (SingleR), but that it is quicker and can handle larger reference datasets. We demonstrate how scMatch can handle large customized reference gene expression profiles that combine data from multiple sources, thus empowering researchers to identify cell populations in any complex tissue with the desired precision. scMatch (Python code) and the FANTOM5 reference dataset are freely available to the research community here https://github.com/forrest-lab/scMatch.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btz295	FALSE	FALSE	LAmbDA: label ambiguous domain adaptation dataset integration reduces batch effects and improves subtype detection	2019-04-30	Rapid advances in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have produced higher-resolution cellular subtypes in multiple tissues and species. Methods are increasingly needed across datasets and species to (i) remove systematic biases, (ii) model multiple datasets with ambiguous labels and (iii) classify cells and map cell type labels. However, most methods only address one of these problems on broad cell types or simulated data using a single model type. It is also important to address higher-resolution cellular subtypes, subtype labels from multiple datasets, models trained on multiple datasets simultaneously and generalizability beyond a single model type. We developed a species- and dataset-independent transfer learning framework (LAmbDA) to train models on multiple datasets (even from different species) and applied our framework on simulated, pancreas and brain scRNA-seq experiments. These models mapped corresponding cell types between datasets with inconsistent cell subtype labels while simultaneously reducing batch effects. We achieved high accuracy in labeling cellular subtypes (weighted accuracy simulated 1 datasets: 90%; simulated 2 datasets: 94%; pancreas datasets: 88% and brain datasets: 66%) using LAmbDA Feedforward 1 Layer Neural Network with bagging. This method achieved higher weighted accuracy in labeling cellular subtypes than two other state-of-the-art methods, scmap and CaSTLe in brain (66% versus 60% and 32%). Furthermore, it achieved better performance in correctly predicting ambiguous cellular subtype labels across datasets in 88% of test cases compared with CaSTLe (63%), scmap (50%) and MetaNeighbor (50%). LAmbDA is model- and dataset-independent and generalizable to diverse data types representing an advance in biocomputing. github.com/tsteelejohnson91/LAmbDA Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	880	2.409308692676249	9	55	11	0.0125	2.25
10.1093/bioinformatics/btz296	FALSE	FALSE	Continuous-state HMMs for modeling time-series single-cell RNA-Seq data	2019-04-30	Methods for reconstructing developmental trajectories from time-series single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data can be largely divided into two categories. The first, often referred to as pseudotime ordering methods are deterministic and rely on dimensionality reduction followed by an ordering step. The second learns a probabilistic branching model to represent the developmental process. While both types have been successful, each suffers from shortcomings that can impact their accuracy. We developed a new method based on continuous-state HMMs (CSHMMs) for representing and modeling time-series scRNA-Seq data. We define the CSHMM model and provide efficient learning and inference algorithms which allow the method to determine both the structure of the branching process and the assignment of cells to these branches. Analyzing several developmental single-cell datasets, we show that the CSHMM method accurately infers branching topology and correctly and continuously assign cells to paths, improving upon prior methods proposed for this task. Analysis of genes based on the continuous cell assignment identifies known and novel markers for different cell types.

However, a critical challenge faced by researchers is how to optimize the choices of sequencing platforms, sequencing depths and cell numbers in designing scRNA-seq experiments, so as to balance the exploration of the depth and breadth of transcriptome information. Here we present a flexible and robust simulator, scDesign, the first statistical framework for researchers to quantitatively assess practical scRNA-seq experimental design in the context of differential gene expression analysis. In addition to experimental design, scDesign also assists computational method development by generating high-quality synthetic scRNA-seq datasets under customized experimental settings. In an evaluation based on 17 cell types and 6 different protocols, scDesign outperformed four state-of-the-art scRNA-seq simulation methods and led to rational experimental design. In addition, scDesign demonstrates reproducibility across biological replicates and independent studies. We also discuss the performance of multiple differential expression and dimension reduction methods based on the protocol-dependent scRNA-seq data generated by scDesign. scDesign is expected to be an effective bioinformatic tool that assists rational scRNA-seq experimental design and comparison of scRNA–seq computational methods based on specific research goals. We have implemented our method in the R package scDesign, which is freely available at https://github.com/Vivianstats/scDesign.

Existing methods have important drawbacks, including among others lack of parsimony, non-convexity and computational overhead. Here we propose block HSIC Lasso, a non-linear feature selector that does not present the previous drawbacks.We compare block HSIC Lasso to other state-of-the-art feature selection techniques in both synthetic and real data, including experiments over three common types of genomic data: gene-expression microarrays, single-cell RNA sequencing and genome-wide association studies. In all cases, we observe that features selected by block HSIC Lasso retain more information about the underlying biology than those selected by other techniques. As a proof of concept, we applied block HSIC Lasso to a single-cell RNA sequencing experiment on mouse hippocampus. We discovered that many genes linked in the past to brain development and function are involved in the biological differences between the types of neurons.Block HSIC Lasso is implemented in the Python 2/3 package pyHSICLasso, available on PyPI.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btz351	FALSE	FALSE	Minnow: a principled framework for rapid simulation of dscRNA-seq data at the read level	2019-07-05	With the advancements of high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing protocols, there has been a rapid increase in the tools available to perform an array of analyses on the gene expression data that results from such studies. For example, there exist methods for pseudo-time series analysis, differential cell usage, cell-type detection RNA-velocity in single cells, etc. Most analysis pipelines validate their results using known marker genes (which are not widely available for all types of analysis) and by using simulated data from gene-count-level simulators. Typically, the impact of using different read-alignment or unique molecular identifier (UMI) deduplication methods has not been widely explored. Assessments based on simulation tend to start at the level of assuming a simulated count matrix, ignoring the effect that different approaches for resolving UMI counts from the raw read data may produce. Here, we present minnow, a comprehensive sequence-level droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (dscRNA-seq) experiment simulation framework. Minnow accounts for important sequence-level characteristics of experimental scRNA-seq datasets and models effects such as polymerase chain reaction amplification, cellular barcodes (CB) and UMI selection and sequence fragmentation and sequencing. It also closely matches the gene-level ambiguity characteristics that are observed in real scRNA-seq experiments. Using minnow, we explore the performance of some common processing pipelines to produce gene-by-cell count matrices from droplet-bases scRNA-seq data, demonstrate the effect that realistic levels of gene-level sequence ambiguity can have on accurate quantification and show a typical use-case of minnow in assessing the output generated by different quantification pipelines on the simulated experiment.

Despite this, few current methods for differential expression (DE) analysis of scRNA-seq data explicitly model the process that gives rise to the dropout events. We develop DECENT, a method for DE analysis of scRNA-seq data that explicitly and accurately models the molecule capture process in scRNA-seq experiments. We show that DECENT demonstrates improved DE performance over existing DE methods that do not explicitly model dropout. This improvement is consistently observed across several public scRNA-seq datasets generated using different technological platforms. The gain in improvement is especially large when the capture process is overdispersed. DECENT maintains type I error well while achieving better sensitivity. Its performance without spike-ins is almost as good as when spike-ins are used to calibrate the capture model. The method is implemented as a publicly available R package available from https://github.com/cz-ye/DECENT.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btz592	FALSE	FALSE	ACTINN: automated identification of cell types in single cell RNA sequencing	2019-07-29	Cell type identification is one of the major goals in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Current methods for assigning cell types typically involve the use of unsupervised clustering, the identification of signature genes in each cluster, followed by a manual lookup of these genes in the literature and databases to assign cell types. However, there are several limitations associated with these approaches, such as unwanted sources of variation that influence clustering and a lack of canonical markers for certain cell types. Here, we present ACTINN (Automated Cell Type Identification using Neural Networks), which employs a neural network with three hidden layers, trains on datasets with predefined cell types and predicts cell types for other datasets based on the trained parameters. We trained the neural network on a mouse cell type atlas (Tabula Muris Atlas) and a human immune cell dataset, and used it to predict cell types for mouse leukocytes, human PBMCs and human T cell sub types. The results showed that our neural network is fast and accurate, and should therefore be a useful tool to complement existing scRNA-seq pipelines. The codes and datasets are available at https://figshare.com/articles/ACTINN/8967116. Tutorial is available at https://github.com/mafeiyang/ACTINN. All codes are implemented in python.

However, the data are noise-prone because gene expression is often driven by both technical artifacts and genuine biological variations. Proper disentanglement of these two effects is critical to prevent spurious results. While several tools exist to detect and remove low-quality cells in one single cell RNA-seq dataset, there is lack of approach to examining consistency between sample sets and detecting systematic biases, batch effects and outliers. We present scRNABatchQC, an R package to compare multiple sample sets simultaneously over numerous technical and biological features, which gives valuable hints to distinguish technical artifact from biological variations. scRNABatchQC helps identify and systematically characterize sources of variability in single cell transcriptome data. The examination of consistency across datasets allows visual detection of biases and outliers. scRNABatchQC is freely available at https://github.com/liuqivandy/scRNABatchQC as an R package.

A number of methods have been developed to combine diverse datasets by removing technical batch effects, but most are computationally intensive. To overcome the challenge of enormous datasets, we have developed BBKNN, an extremely fast graph-based data integration algorithm. We illustrate the power of BBKNN on large scale mouse atlasing data, and favourably benchmark its run time against a number of competing methods.

However, scRNA-seq data suffer from problems of extremely high dropout rate and cell-to-cell variability, demanding new methods to recover gene expression loss. Despite the availability of various dropout imputation approaches for scRNA-seq, most studies focus on data with a medium or large number of cells, while few studies have explicitly investigated the differential performance across different sample sizes or the applicability of the approach on small or imbalanced data. It is imperative to develop new imputation approaches with higher generalizability for data with various sample sizes. We proposed a method called scHinter for imputing dropout events for scRNA-seq with special emphasis on data with limited sample size. scHinter incorporates a voting-based ensemble distance and leverages the synthetic minority oversampling technique for random interpolation. A hierarchical framework is also embedded in scHinter to increase the reliability of the imputation for small samples. We demonstrated the ability of scHinter to recover gene expression measurements across a wide spectrum of scRNA-seq datasets with varied sample sizes. We comprehensively examined the impact of sample size and cluster number on imputation. Comprehensive evaluation of scHinter across diverse scRNA-seq datasets with imbalanced or limited sample size showed that scHinter achieved higher and more robust performance than competing approaches, including MAGIC, scImpute, SAVER and netSmooth.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btz692	FALSE	FALSE	QUBIC2: a novel and robust biclustering algorithm for analyses and interpretation of large-scale RNA-Seq data	2019-09-10	The biclustering of large-scale gene expression data holds promising potential for detecting condition-specific functional gene modules (i.e. biclusters). However, existing methods do not adequately address a comprehensive detection of all significant bicluster structures and have limited power when applied to expression data generated by RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq), especially single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data, where massive zero and low expression values are observed. We present a new biclustering algorithm, QUalitative BIClustering algorithm Version 2 (QUBIC2), which is empowered by: (i) a novel left-truncated mixture of Gaussian model for an accurate assessment of multimodality in zero-enriched expression data, (ii) a fast and efficient dropouts-saving expansion strategy for functional gene modules optimization using information divergency and (iii) a rigorous statistical test for the significance of all the identified biclusters in any organism, including those without substantial functional annotations. QUBIC2 demonstrated considerably improved performance in detecting biclusters compared to other five widely used algorithms on various benchmark datasets from E.coli, Human and simulated data. QUBIC2 also showcased robust and superior performance on gene expression data generated by microarray, bulk RNA-Seq and scRNA-Seq.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btz698	FALSE	FALSE	scds: Computational Annotation of Doublets in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data	2019-09-10	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable the study of transcriptional heterogeneity at the resolution of individual cells and have an increasing impact on biomedical research. However, it is known that these methods sometimes wrongly consider two or more cells as single cells, and that a number of so-called doublets is present in the output of such experiments. Treating doublets as single cells in downstream analyses can severely bias a study’s conclusions, and therefore computational strategies for the identification of doublets are needed. With scds, we propose two new approaches for in silico doublet identification: Co-expression based doublet scoring (cxds) and binary classification based doublet scoring (bcds). The co-expression based approach, cxds, utilizes binarized (absence/presence) gene expression data and, employing a binomial model for the co-expression of pairs of genes, yields interpretable doublet annotations. bcds, on the other hand, uses a binary classification approach to discriminate artificial doublets from original data. We apply our methods and existing computational doublet identification approaches to four datasets with experimental doublet annotations and find that our methods perform at least as well as the state of the art, at comparably little computational cost. We observe appreciable differences between methods and across datasets and that no approach dominates all others. In summary, scds presents a scalable, competitive approach that allows for doublet annotation of datasets with thousands of cells in a matter of seconds. scds is implemented as a Bioconductor R package (doi: 10.18129/B9.bioc.scds).

10.1093/bioinformatics/btz701	FALSE	FALSE	scDAPA: detection and visualization of dynamic alternative polyadenylation from single cell RNA-seq data	2019-09-06	Alternative polyadenylation (APA) plays a key post-transcriptional regulatory role in mRNA stability and functions in eukaryotes. Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool to discover cellular heterogeneity at gene expression level. Given 3′ enriched strategy in library construction, the most commonly used scRNA-seq protocol—10× Genomics enables us to improve the study resolution of APA to the single cell level. However, currently there is no computational tool available for investigating APA profiles from scRNA-seq data. Here, we present a package scDAPA for detecting and visualizing dynamic APA from scRNA-seq data. Taking bam/sam files and cell cluster labels as inputs, scDAPA detects APA dynamics using a histogram-based method and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and visualizes candidate genes with dynamic APA. Benchmarking results demonstrated that scDAPA can effectively identify genes with dynamic APA among different cell groups from scRNA-seq data. The scDAPA package is implemented in Shell and R, and is freely available at https://scdapa.sourceforge.io.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btz704	FALSE	FALSE	Spectrum: fast density-aware spectral clustering for single and multi-omic data	2019-09-10	Clustering patient omic data is integral to developing precision medicine because it allows the identification of disease subtypes. A current major challenge is the integration multi-omic data to identify a shared structure and reduce noise. Cluster analysis is also increasingly applied on single-omic data, for example, in single cell RNA-seq analysis for clustering the transcriptomes of individual cells. This technology has clinical implications. Our motivation was therefore to develop a flexible and effective spectral clustering tool for both single and multi-omic data. We present Spectrum, a new spectral clustering method for complex omic data. Spectrum uses a self-tuning density-aware kernel we developed that enhances the similarity between points that share common nearest neighbours. It uses a tensor product graph data integration and diffusion procedure to reduce noise and reveal underlying structures. Spectrum contains a new method for finding the optimal number of clusters (K) involving eigenvector distribution analysis. Spectrum can automatically find K for both Gaussian and non-Gaussian structures. We demonstrate across 21 real expression datasets that Spectrum gives improved runtimes and better clustering results relative to other methods. Spectrum is available as an R software package from CRAN https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Spectrum/index.html.

The marked technical variability, high amounts of missing observations and batch effect typical of scRNA-seq datasets make this task particularly challenging. There is a need for an efficient and unified approach for normalization, imputation and batch effect correction. Here, we introduce bayNorm, a novel Bayesian approach for scaling and inference of scRNA-seq counts. The method’s likelihood function follows a binomial model of mRNA capture, while priors are estimated from expression values across cells using an empirical Bayes approach. We first validate our assumptions by showing this model can reproduce different statistics observed in real scRNA-seq data. We demonstrate using publicly available scRNA-seq datasets and simulated expression data that bayNorm allows robust imputation of missing values generating realistic transcript distributions that match single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization measurements. Moreover, by using priors informed by dataset structures, bayNorm improves accuracy and sensitivity of differential expression analysis and reduces batch effect compared with other existing methods. Altogether, bayNorm provides an efficient, integrated solution for global scaling normalization, imputation and true count recovery of gene expression measurements from scRNA-seq data. The R package ‘bayNorm’ is publishd on bioconductor at https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/bayNorm.html.

For this reason, the development of new methods for handling scRNA-seq count data is currently one of the most active research fields in bioinformatics. To help the development of such new methods, the availability of simulated data could play a pivotal role. However, only few scRNA-seq count data simulators are available, often showing poor or not demonstrated similarity with real data.In this article we present SPARSim, a scRNA-seq count data simulator based on a Gamma-Multivariate Hypergeometric model. We demonstrate that SPARSim allows to generate count data that resemble real data in terms of count intensity, variability and sparsity, performing comparably or better than one of the most used scRNA-seq simulator, Splat. In particular, SPARSim simulated count matrices well resemble the distribution of zeros across different expression intensities observed in real count data.SPARSim R package is freely available at http://sysbiobig.dei.unipd.it/? q=SPARSim and at https://gitlab.com/sysbiobig/sparsim.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	718	1.9657768651608487	3	56	6	0.008356545961002786	12.43
10.1093/bioinformatics/btz778	FALSE	FALSE	GPseudoClust: deconvolution of shared pseudo-profiles at single-cell resolution	2019-10-14	Many methods have been developed to cluster genes on the basis of their changes in mRNA expression over time, using bulk RNA-seq or microarray data. However, single-cell data may present a particular challenge for these algorithms, since the temporal ordering of cells is not directly observed. One way to address this is to first use pseudotime methods to order the cells, and then apply clustering techniques for time course data. However, pseudotime estimates are subject to high levels of uncertainty, and failing to account for this uncertainty is liable to lead to erroneous and/or over-confident gene clusters. The proposed method, GPseudoClust, is a novel approach that jointly infers pseudotemporal ordering and gene clusters, and quantifies the uncertainty in both. GPseudoClust combines a recent method for pseudotime inference with nonparametric Bayesian clustering methods, efficient MCMC sampling, and novel subsampling strategies which aid computation.We consider a broad array of simulated and experimental datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of GPseudoClust in a range of settings. An implementation is available on GitHub: https://github.com/magStra/nonparametricSummaryPSM and https://github.com/magStra/GPseudoClust.

10.1093/bioinformatics/btz789	FALSE	FALSE	DPre: Computational identification of differentiation bias and genes underlying cell type conversions	2019-10-17	Cells are generally resistant to cell type conversions, but can be converted by the application of growth factors, chemical inhibitors and ectopic expression of genes. However, it remains difficult to accurately identify the destination cell type or differentiation bias when these techniques are used to alter cell type. Consequently, there is demand for computational techniques that can help researchers understand both the cell type and differentiation bias. While advanced tools identifying cell types exist for single cell data and the deconvolution of mixed cell populations, the problem of exploring partially differentiated cells of indeterminate transcriptional identity has not been addressed. To fill this gap, we developed driver-predictor, which relies on scoring per gene transcriptional similarity between RNA-Seq datasets to reveal directional bias of differentiation. By comparing against large cell type transcriptome libraries or a desired target expression profile, the tool enables the user to visualize both the changes in transcriptional identity as well as the genes accounting for the cell type changes. This software will be a powerful tool for researchers to explore in vitro experiments that involve cell type conversions.

It is thus of interest to eliminate the use of sequencing depth and analyze the original count data directly. We call an analysis method ‘scale-invariant’ (SI) if it gives the same result under different estimates of sequencing depth and hence can use the original count data without scaling. For the problem of classifying samples into pre-specified classes, such as normal versus cancerous, we develop a deep-neural-network based SI classifier named scale-invariant deep neural-network classifier (SINC). On nine bulk and single-cell datasets, the classification accuracy of SINC is better than or competitive to the best of eight other classifiers. SINC is easier to use and more reliable on data where proper sequencing depth is hard to determine. This source code of SINC is available at https://www.nd.edu/∼jli9/SINC.zip.

Despite exponential increase in data generation, systematic identification of key regulatory factors for controlling cellular phenotype to enable cell rejuvenation in disease or ageing remains a challenge. Here, we present SigHotSpotter, a computational tool to predict hotspots of signaling pathways responsible for the stable maintenance of cell subpopulation phenotypes, by integrating signaling and transcriptional networks. Targeted perturbation of these signaling hotspots can enable precise control of cell subpopulation phenotypes. SigHotSpotter correctly predicts the signaling hotspots with known experimental validations in different cellular systems. The tool is simple, user-friendly and is available as web-server or as stand-alone software. We believe SigHotSpotter will serve as a general purpose tool for the systematic prediction of signaling hotspots based on single-cell RNA-seq data, and potentiate novel cell rejuvenation strategies in the context of disease and ageing.

Here, we present Cerebro (cell report browser), a Shiny- and Electron-based standalone desktop application for macOS and Windows which allows investigation and inspection of pre-processed single-cell transcriptomics data without requiring bioinformatic experience of the user. Through an interactive and intuitive graphical interface, users can (i) explore similarities and heterogeneity between samples and cell clusters in two-dimensional or three-dimensional projections such as t-SNE or UMAP, (ii) display the expression level of single genes or gene sets of interest, (iii) browse tables of most expressed genes and marker genes for each sample and cluster and (iv) display trajectories calculated with Monocle 2. We provide three examples prepared from publicly available datasets to show how Cerebro can be used and which are its capabilities. Through a focus on flexibility and direct access to data and results, we think Cerebro offers a collaborative framework for bioinformaticians and experimental biologists that facilitates effective interaction to shorten the gap between analysis and interpretation of the data.

Hundreds of bespoke methods have been developed in the past few years to deal with various aspects of single-cell analysis and consensus on the most appropriate methods to use under different settings is still emerging. Benchmarking the many methods is therefore of critical importance and since analysis of single-cell data usually involves multi-step pipelines, effective evaluation of pipelines involving different combinations of methods is required. Current benchmarks of single-cell methods are mostly implemented with ad-hoc code that is often difficult to reproduce or extend, and exhaustive manual coding of many combinations is infeasible in most instances. Therefore, new software is needed to manage pipeline benchmarking. The CellBench R software facilitates method comparisons in either a task-centric or combinatorial way to allow pipelines of methods to be evaluated in an effective manner. CellBench automatically runs combinations of methods, provides facilities for measuring running time and delivers output in tabular form which is highly compatible with tidyverse R packages for summary and visualization. Our software has enabled comprehensive benchmarking of single-cell RNA-seq normalization, imputation, clustering, trajectory analysis and data integration methods using various performance metrics obtained from data with available ground truth.

However, data analyses are challenging in dealing with noise, sparsity and poor annotation at single cell resolution. Detecting cell-type-indicative markers is promising to help denoising, clustering and cell type annotation. We developed a new method, scTIM, to reveal cell-type-indicative markers. scTIM is based on a multi-objective optimization framework to simultaneously maximize gene specificity by considering gene-cell relationship, maximize gene’s ability to reconstruct cell–cell relationship and minimize gene redundancy by considering gene–gene relationship. Furthermore, consensus optimization is introduced for robust solution. Experimental results on three diverse single cell RNA-seq datasets show scTIM’s advantages in identifying cell types (clustering), annotating cell types and reconstructing cell development trajectory. Applying scTIM to the large-scale mouse cell atlas data identifies critical markers for 15 tissues as ‘mouse cell marker atlas’, which allows us to investigate identities of different tissues and subtle cell types within a tissue. scTIM will serve as a useful method for single cell RNA-seq data mining. scTIM is freely available at https://github.com/Frank-Orwell/scTIM.

This issue has inspired several clustering methods to classify cells in scRNA-seq data. However, accurate prediction of the cell clusters remains a substantial challenge. In this study, we propose a new algorithm for scRNA-seq data clustering based on Sparse Optimization and low-rank matrix factorization (scSO). We applied our scSO algorithm to analyze multiple benchmark datasets and showed that the cluster number predicted by scSO was close to the number of reference cell types and that most cells were correctly classified.

10.1093/gigascience/giaa113	FALSE	FALSE	Prediction of single-cell gene expression for transcription factor analysis	2020-10-30	Single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful technology to discover new cell types and study biological processes in complex biological samples. A current challenge is to predict transcription factor (TF) regulation from single-cell RNA data. Here, we propose a novel approach for predicting gene expression at the single-cell level using cis-regulatory motifs, as well as epigenetic features. We designed a tree-guided multi-task learning framework that considers each cell as a task. Through this framework we were able to explain the single-cell gene expression values using either TF binding affinities or TF ChIP-seq data measured at specific genomic regions. TFs identified using these models could be validated by the literature. Our proposed method allows us to identify distinct TFs that show cell type–specific regulation. This approach is not limited to TFs but can use any type of data that can potentially be used in explaining gene expression at the single-cell level to study factors that drive differentiation or show abnormal regulation in disease.

Despite recent success, there is a pressing need for specialized methods tailored towards the functional interpretation of these cellular maps. Here, we present DrivAER, a machine learning approach for the identification of driving transcriptional programs using autoencoder-based relevance scores. DrivAER scores annotated gene sets on the basis of their relevance to user-specified outcomes such as pseudotemporal ordering or disease status. DrivAER iteratively evaluates the information content of each gene set with respect to the outcome variable using autoencoders. We benchmark our method using extensive simulation analysis as well as comparison to existing methods for functional interpretation of scRNA-seq data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DrivAER extracts key pathways and transcription factors that regulate complex biological processes from scRNA-seq data. By quantifying the relevance of annotated gene sets with respect to specified outcome variables, DrivAER greatly enhances our ability to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms.	290	0.7939767282683093	3	50	8	0.027586206896551724	15.65
10.1093/gigascience/giaa126	FALSE	FALSE	D-EE: Distributed software for visualizing intrinsic structure of large-scale single-cell data	2020-11-11	Dimensionality reduction and visualization play vital roles in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. While they have been extensively studied, state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction algorithms are often unable to preserve the global structures underlying data. Elastic embedding (EE), a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method, has shown promise in revealing low-dimensional intrinsic local and global data structure. However, the current implementation of the EE algorithm lacks scalability to large-scale scRNA-seq data. We present a distributed optimization implementation of the EE algorithm, termed distributed elastic embedding (D-EE). D-EE reveals the low-dimensional intrinsic structures of data with accuracy equal to that of elastic embedding, and it is scalable to large-scale scRNA-seq data. It leverages distributed storage and distributed computation, achieving memory efficiency and high-performance computing simultaneously. In addition, an extended version of D-EE, termed distributed optimization implementation of time-series elastic embedding (D-TSEE), enables the user to visualize large-scale time-series scRNA-seq data by incorporating experimentally temporal information. Results with large-scale scRNA-seq data indicate that D-TSEE can uncover oscillatory gene expression patterns by using experimentally temporal information. D-EE is a distributed dimensionality reduction and visualization tool. Its distributed storage and distributed computation technique allow us to efficiently analyze large-scale single-cell data at the cost of constant time speedup. The source code for D-EE algorithm based on C and MPI tailored to a high-performance computing cluster is available at https://github.com/ShaokunAn/D-EE.	319	0.8733744010951403	3	31	1	0.003134796238244514	10.08

This sequencing of cell-free RNA constitutes a background contamination that confounds the biological interpretation of single-cell transcriptomic data. We demonstrate that contamination from this ""soup"" of cell-free RNAs is ubiquitous, with experiment-specific variations in composition and magnitude. We present a method, SoupX, for quantifying the extent of the contamination and estimating ""background-corrected"" cell expression profiles that seamlessly integrate with existing downstream analysis tools. Applying this method to several datasets using multiple droplet sequencing technologies, we demonstrate that its application improves biological interpretation of otherwise misleading data, as well as improving quality control metrics.

Analysis of scRNA-seq data is multidisciplinary in nature, requiring careful consideration of the application of statistical methods with respect to the underlying biology. Few analysis packages exist that are at once robust, are computationally fast, and allow flexible integration with other bioinformatics tools and methods. ascend is an R package comprising tools designed to simplify and streamline the preliminary analysis of scRNA-seq data, while addressing the statistical challenges of scRNA-seq analysis and enabling flexible integration with genomics packages and native R functions, including fast parallel computation and efficient memory management. The package incorporates both novel and established methods to provide a framework to perform cell and gene filtering, quality control, normalization, dimension reduction, clustering, differential expression, and a wide range of visualization functions. ascend is designed to work with scRNA-seq data generated by any high-throughput platform and includes functions to convert data objects between software packages. The ascend workflow is simple and interactive, as well as suitable for implementation by a broad range of users, including those with little programming experience.	764	2.0917180013689256	7	18	16	0.020942408376963352	27.33

Single-cell sequencing applications have spread from conventional RNA sequencing to epigenomics, e.g., ATAC-seq. Many related algorithms and tools have been developed, but few computational workflows provide analysis flexibility while also achieving functional (i.e., information about the data and the tools used are saved as metadata) and computational reproducibility (i.e., a real image of the computational environment used to generate the data is stored) through a user-friendly environment. rCASC is a modular workflow providing an integrated analysis environment (from count generation to cell subpopulation identification) exploiting Docker containerization to achieve both functional and computational reproducibility in data analysis. Hence, rCASC provides preprocessing tools to remove low-quality cells and/or specific bias, e.g., cell cycle. Subpopulation discovery can instead be achieved using different clustering techniques based on different distance metrics. Cluster quality is then estimated through the new metric ""cell stability score"" (CSS), which describes the stability of a cell in a cluster as a consequence of a perturbation induced by removing a random set of cells from the cell population. CSS provides better cluster robustness information than the silhouette metric. Moreover, rCASC's tools can identify cluster-specific gene signatures. rCASC is a modular workflow with new features that could help researchers define cell subpopulations and detect subpopulation-specific markers.

Yet, on the cell population level, a subset of genes traditionally referred to as housekeeping genes (HKGs) are found to be stably expressed in different cell and tissue types. It is therefore critical to question whether stably expressed genes (SEGs) can be identified on the single-cell level, and if so, how can their expression stability be assessed? We have previously proposed a computational framework for ranking expression stability of genes in single cells for scRNA-seq data normalization and integration. In this study, we perform detailed evaluation and characterization of SEGs derived from this framework.Here, we show that gene expression stability indices derived from the early human and mouse development scRNA-seq datasets and the ""Mouse Atlas"" dataset are reproducible and conserved across species. We demonstrate that SEGs identified from single cells based on their stability indices are considerably more stable than HKGs defined previously from cell populations across diverse biological systems. Our analyses indicate that SEGs are inherently more stable at the single-cell level and their characteristics reminiscent of HKGs, suggesting their potential role in sustaining essential functions in individual cells.SEGs identified in this study have immediate utility both for understanding variation and stability of single-cell transcriptomes and for practical applications such as scRNA-seq data normalization. Our framework for calculating gene stability index, ""scSEGIndex,"" is incorporated into the scMerge Bioconductor R package (https://sydneybiox.github.io/scMerge/reference/scSEGIndex.html) and can be used for identifying genes with stable expression in scRNA-seq datasets."	741	2.028747433264887	9	58	15	0.020242914979757085	28.93

However, the ability to differentiate between cell groups could be affected by clustering. This interdependency often creates a bottleneck in the analysis pipeline, requiring researchers to repeat these 2 steps multiple times by setting different clustering parameters to identify a set of cell groups that are more differentiated and biologically relevant.To accelerate this process, we have developed IKAP—an algorithm to identify major cell groups and improve differentiating cell groups by systematically tuning parameters for clustering. We demonstrate that, with default parameters, IKAP successfully identifies major cell types such as T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and monocytes in 2 peripheral blood mononuclear cell datasets and recovers major cell types in a previously published mouse cortex dataset. These major cell groups identified by IKAP present more distinguishing DE genes compared with cell groups generated by different combinations of clustering parameters. We further show that cell subtypes can be identified by recursively applying IKAP within identified major cell types, thereby delineating cell identities in a multi-layered ontology.By tuning the clustering parameters to identify major cell groups, IKAP greatly improves the automation of single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis to produce distinguishing DE genes and refine cell ontology using single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	726	1.9876796714579055	8	21	6	0.008264462809917356	2.75

However, the analysis of scRNA-seq data remains a computational challenge due to the high technical noise such as the presence of dropout events that lead to a large proportion of zeros for expressed genes. Taking into account the cell heterogeneity and the relationship between dropout rate and expected expression level, we present a cell sub-population based bounded low-rank (PBLR) method to impute the dropouts of scRNA-seq data. Through application to both simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets, PBLR is shown to be effective in recovering dropout events, and it can dramatically improve the low-dimensional representation and the recovery of gene‒gene relationships masked by dropout events compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, PBLR also detects accurate and robust cell sub-populations automatically, shedding light on its flexibility and generality for scRNA-seq data analysis.	360	0.9856262833675564	2	37	3	0.008333333333333333	3
10.1093/nar/gkaa1014	FALSE	FALSE	TENET: gene network reconstruction using transfer entropy reveals key regulatory factors from single cell transcriptomic data	2020-11-10	Accurate prediction of gene regulatory rules is important towards understanding of cellular processes. Existing computational algorithms devised for bulk transcriptomics typically require a large number of time points to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs), are applicable for a small number of genes and fail to detect potential causal relationships effectively. Here, we propose a novel approach ‘TENET’ to reconstruct GRNs from single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets. Employing transfer entropy (TE) to measure the amount of causal relationships between genes, TENET predicts large-scale gene regulatory cascades/relationships from scRNAseq data. TENET showed better performance than other GRN reconstructors, in identifying key regulators from public datasets. Specifically from scRNAseq, TENET identified key transcriptional factors in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and during direct cardiomyocytes reprogramming, where other predictors failed. We further demonstrate that known target genes have significantly higher TE values, and TENET predicted higher TE genes were more influenced by the perturbation of their regulator. Using TENET, we identified and validated that Nme2 is a culture condition specific stem cell factor. These results indicate that TENET is uniquely capable of identifying key regulators from scRNAseq data.	320	0.8761122518822724	4	68	4	0.0125	24.75

Here, we introduce UniPath, for representing single-cells using pathway and gene-set enrichment scores by a transformation of their open-chromatin or gene-expression profiles. The robust statistical approach of UniPath provides high accuracy, consistency and scalability in estimating gene-set enrichment scores for every cell. Its framework provides an easy solution for handling variability in drop-out rate, which can sometimes create artefact due to systematic patterns. UniPath provides an alternative approach of dimension reduction of single-cell open-chromatin profiles. UniPath's approach of predicting temporal-order of single-cells using their pathway enrichment scores enables suppression of covariates to achieve correct order of cells. Analysis of mouse cell atlas using our approach yielded surprising, albeit biologically-meaningful co-clustering of cell-types from distant organs. By enabling an unconventional method of exploiting pathway co-occurrence to compare two groups of cells, our approach also proves to be useful in inferring context-specific regulations in cancer cells.

Consensus partitioning is the most widely applied approach to reveal subgroups by summarizing a consensus classification from a list of individual classifications generated by repeatedly executing clustering on random subsets of the data. It is able to evaluate the stability of the classification. We implemented a new R/Bioconductor package, cola, that provides a general framework for consensus partitioning. With cola, various parameters and methods can be user-defined and easily integrated into different steps of an analysis, e.g., feature selection, sample classification or defining signatures. cola provides a new method named ATC (ability to correlate to other rows) to extract features and recommends spherical k-means clustering (skmeans) for subgroup classification. We show that ATC and skmeans have better performance than other commonly used methods by a comprehensive benchmark on public datasets. We also benchmark key parameters in the consensus partitioning procedure, which helps users to select optimal parameter values. Moreover, cola provides rich functionalities to apply multiple partitioning methods in parallel and directly compare their results, as well as rich visualizations. cola can automate the complete analysis and generates a comprehensive HTML report.	296	0.810403832991102	3	36	7	0.02364864864864865	3.35

However, the noise inherent in single-cell RNA-sequencing data severely disturbs the accuracy of cell clustering, marker identification and visualization. We propose that clustering based on feature density profiles can distinguish informative features from noise. We named such strategy as ‘entropy subspace’ separation and designed a cell clustering algorithm called ENtropy subspace separation-based Clustering for nOise REduction (ENCORE) by integrating the ‘entropy subspace’ separation strategy with a consensus clustering method. We demonstrate that ENCORE performs superiorly on cell clustering and generates high-resolution visualization across 12 standard datasets. More importantly, ENCORE enables identification of group markers with biological significance from a hard-to-separate dataset. With the advantages of effective feature selection, improved clustering, accurate marker identification and high-resolution visualization, we present ENCORE to the community as an important tool for scRNA-seq data analysis to study cellular heterogeneity and discover group markers.	290	0.7939767282683093	9	38	1	0.0034482758620689655	3.35

SingleCellSignalR is implemented as an open-access R package accessible to entry-level users and available from https://github.com/SCA-IRCM. Analysis results come in a variety of tabular and graphical formats. For instance, we provide a unique network view integrating all the intercellular interactions, and a function relating receptors to expressed intracellular pathways.

More recently, coupled with the cutting-edge Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq), the droplet-based system has allowed for immunophenotyping of single cells based on cell surface expression of specific proteins together with simultaneous transcriptome profiling in the same cell. Despite the rapid advances in technologies, novel statistical methods and computational tools for analyzing multi-modal CITE-Seq data are lacking. In this study, we developed BREM-SC, a novel Bayesian Random Effects Mixture model that jointly clusters paired single cell transcriptomic and proteomic data. Through simulation studies and analysis of public and in-house real data sets, we successfully demonstrated the validity and advantages of this method in fully utilizing both types of data to accurately identify cell clusters. In addition, as a probabilistic model-based approach, BREM-SC is able to quantify the clustering uncertainty for each single cell. This new method will greatly facilitate researchers to jointly study transcriptome and surface proteins at the single cell level to make new biological discoveries, particularly in the area of immunology.	507	1.3880903490759753	10	27	16	0.03155818540433925	0.5

However, this analytical revolution also triggered new demands in ‘big data’ management, forcing researchers to stay up to speed with increasingly complex analytical processes and rapidly evolving methods. To render these processes and approaches more accessible, we developed the web-based, collaborative portal ASAP (Automated Single-cell Analysis Portal). Our primary goal is thereby to democratize single-cell omics data analyses (scRNA-seq and more recently scATAC-seq). By taking advantage of a Docker system to enhance reproducibility, and novel bioinformatics approaches that were recently developed for improving scalability, ASAP meets challenging requirements set by recent cell atlasing efforts such as the Human (HCA) and Fly (FCA) Cell Atlas Projects. Specifically, ASAP can now handle datasets containing millions of cells, integrating intuitive tools that allow researchers to collaborate on the same project synchronously. ASAP tools are versioned, and researchers can create unique access IDs for storing complete analyses that can be reproduced or completed by others. Finally, ASAP does not require any installation and provides a full and modular single-cell RNA-seq analysis pipeline.

However, it suffers from many sources of technical noises, including insufficient mRNA molecules that lead to excess false zero values, termed dropouts. Computational approaches have been proposed to recover the biologically meaningful expression by borrowing information from similar cells in the observed dataset. However, these methods suffer from oversmoothing and removal of natural cell-to-cell stochasticity in gene expression. Here, we propose the generative adversarial networks (GANs) for scRNA-seq imputation (scIGANs), which uses generated cells rather than observed cells to avoid these limitations and balances the performance between major and rare cell populations. Evaluations based on a variety of simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets show that scIGANs is effective for dropout imputation and enhances various downstream analysis. ScIGANs is robust to small datasets that have very few genes with low expression and/or cell-to-cell variance. ScIGANs works equally well on datasets from different scRNA-seq protocols and is scalable to datasets with over 100 000 cells. We demonstrated in many ways with compelling evidence that scIGANs is not only an application of GANs in omics data but also represents a competing imputation method for the scRNA-seq data.	457	1.2511978097193703	6	54	18	0.03938730853391685	2.75
10.1093/nar/gkaa582	FALSE	FALSE	Variance-adjusted Mahalanobis (VAM): a fast and accurate method for cell-specific gene set scoring	2020-07-07	Statistical analysis of single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is hindered by high levels of technical noise and inflated zero counts. One promising approach for addressing these challenges is gene set testing, or pathway analysis, which can mitigate sparsity and noise, and improve interpretation and power, by aggregating expression data to the pathway level. Unfortunately, methods optimized for bulk transcriptomics perform poorly on scRNA-seq data and progress on single cell-specific techniques has been limited. Importantly, no existing methods support cell-level gene set inference. To address this challenge, we developed a new gene set testing method, Variance-adjusted Mahalanobis (VAM), that integrates with the Seurat framework and can accommodate the technical noise, sparsity and large sample sizes characteristic of scRNA-seq data. The VAM method computes cell-specific pathway scores to transform a cell-by-gene matrix into a cell-by-pathway matrix that can be used for both data visualization and statistical enrichment analysis. Because the distribution of these scores under the null of uncorrelated technical noise has an accurate gamma approximation, both population and cell-level inference is supported. As demonstrated using simulated and real scRNA-seq data, the VAM method provides superior classification accuracy at a lower computation cost relative to existing single sample gene set testing approaches.	446	1.2210814510609171	1	42	4	0.008968609865470852	3.5

Combining newly generated and publicly accessible datasets is challenging due to non-biological signals, commonly known as batch effects. Although there are several computational methods available that can remove batch effects, evaluating which method performs best is not straightforward. Here, we present BatchBench (https://github.com/cellgeni/batchbench), a modular and flexible pipeline for comparing batch correction methods for single-cell RNA-seq data. We apply BatchBench to eight methods, highlighting their methodological differences and assess their performance and computational requirements through a compendium of well-studied datasets.

However, the current methods are mainly based on overall co-expression correlation and overlook co-expression that exists in only a subset of cells, thus fail to discover certain rare cell types and sensitive to batch effect. Here, we developed independent component analysis-based gene co-expression network inference (ICAnet) that decomposed scRNA-seq data into a series of independent gene expression components and inferred co-expression modules, which improved cell clustering and rare cell-type discovery. ICAnet showed efficient performance for cell clustering and batch integration using scRNA-seq datasets spanning multiple cells/tissues/donors/library types. It works stably on datasets produced by different library construction strategies and with different sequencing depths and cell numbers. We demonstrated the capability of ICAnet to discover rare cell types in multiple independent scRNA-seq datasets from different sources. Importantly, the identified modules activated in acute myeloid leukemia scRNA-seq datasets have the potential to serve as new diagnostic markers. Thus, ICAnet is a competitive tool for cell clustering and biological interpretations of single-cell RNA-seq data analysis.	216	0.5913757700205339	9	104	2	0.009259259259259259	12.85

To this end, we present mtSC, a flexible single-cell assignment framework that integrates multiple references based on multitask deep metric learning designed specifically for cell type identification within tissues with multiple single-cell sequencing data as references.

10.1093/nar/gkab457	FALSE	FALSE	PseudoGA: cell pseudotime reconstruction based on genetic algorithm	2021-07-09	Dynamic regulation of gene expression is often governed by progression through transient cell states. Bulk RNA-seq analysis can only detect average change in expression levels and is unable to identify this dynamics. Single cell RNA-seq presents an unprecedented opportunity that helps in placing the cells on a hypothetical time trajectory that reflects gradual transition of their transcriptomes. This continuum trajectory or ‘pseudotime’, may reveal the developmental pathway and provide us with information on dynamic transcriptomic changes and other biological processes. Existing approaches to build pseudotime heavily depend on reducing huge dimension to extremely low dimensional subspaces and may lead to loss of information. We propose PseudoGA, a genetic algorithm based approach to order cells assuming that gene expressions vary according to a smooth curve along the pseudotime trajectory. We observe superior accuracy of our method in simulated as well as benchmarking real datasets. Generality of the assumption behind PseudoGA and no dependence on dimensionality reduction technique make it a robust choice for pseudotime estimation from single cell transcriptome data. PseudoGA is also time efficient when applied to a large single cell RNA-seq data and adaptable to parallel computing.

10.1093/nar/gkab481	FALSE	FALSE	Cell type hierarchy reconstruction via reconciliation of multi-resolution cluster tree	2021-06-14	A wealth of clustering algorithms are available for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to enable the identification of functionally distinct subpopulations that each possess a different pattern of gene expression activity. Implementation of these methods requires a choice of resolution parameter to determine the number of clusters, and critical judgment from the researchers is required to determine the desired resolution. This supervised process takes significant time and effort. Moreover, it can be difficult to compare and characterize the evolution of cell clusters from results obtained at one single resolution. To overcome these challenges, we built Multi-resolution Reconciled Tree (MRtree), a highly flexible tree-construction algorithm that generates a cluster hierarchy from flat clustering results attained for a range of resolutions. Because MRtree can be coupled with most scRNA-seq clustering algorithms, it inherits the robustness and versatility of a flat clustering approach, while maintaining the hierarchical structure of cells. The constructed trees from multiple scRNA-seq datasets effectively reflect the extent of transcriptional distinctions among cell groups and align well with levels of functional specializations among cells. Importantly, application to fetal brain cells identified subtypes of cells determined mainly by maturation states, spatial location and terminal specification.	104	0.28473648186173856	6	23	0	0	2.5
10.1093/nar/gkab552	FALSE	FALSE	Multi-resolution characterization of molecular taxonomies in bulk and single-cell transcriptomics data	2021-07-06	As high-throughput genomics assays become more efficient and cost effective, their utilization has become standard in large-scale biomedical projects. These studies are often explorative, in that relationships between samples are not explicitly defined a priori, but rather emerge from data-driven discovery and annotation of molecular subtypes, thereby informing hypotheses and independent evaluation. Here, we present K2Taxonomer, a novel unsupervised recursive partitioning algorithm and associated R package that utilize ensemble learning to identify robust subgroups in a ‘taxonomy-like’ structure. K2Taxonomer was devised to accommodate different data paradigms, and is suitable for the analysis of both bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, and other ‘-omics’, data. For each of these data types, we demonstrate the power of K2Taxonomer to discover known relationships in both simulated and human tissue data. We conclude with a practical application on breast cancer tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) single-cell profiles, in which we identified co-expression of translational machinery genes as a dominant transcriptional program shared by T cells subtypes, associated with better prognosis in breast cancer tissue bulk expression data.	82	0.2245037645448323	2	76	1	0.012195121951219513	37.2

10.1093/nar/gkab632	FALSE	FALSE	RCA2: a scalable supervised clustering algorithm that reduces batch effects in scRNA-seq data	2021-07-28	The transcriptomic diversity of cell types in the human body can be analysed in unprecedented detail using single cell (SC) technologies. Unsupervised clustering of SC transcriptomes, which is the default technique for defining cell types, is prone to group cells by technical, rather than biological, variation. Compared to de-novo (unsupervised) clustering, we demonstrate using multiple benchmarks that supervised clustering, which uses reference transcriptomes as a guide, is robust to batch effects and data quality artifacts. Here, we present RCA2, the first algorithm to combine reference projection (batch effect robustness) with graph-based clustering (scalability). In addition, RCA2 provides a user-friendly framework incorporating multiple commonly used downstream analysis modules. RCA2 also provides new reference panels for human and mouse and supports generation of custom panels. Furthermore, RCA2 facilitates cell type-specific QC, which is essential for accurate clustering of data from heterogeneous tissues. We demonstrate the advantages of RCA2 on SC data from human bone marrow, healthy PBMCs and PBMCs from COVID-19 patients. Scalable supervised clustering methods such as RCA2 will facilitate unified analysis of cohort-scale SC datasets.	60	0.16427104722792607	12	50	0	0	12.1
10.1093/nar/gkab638	FALSE	FALSE	CellCall: integrating paired ligand–receptor and transcription factor activities for cell–cell communication	2021-07-31	With the dramatic development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, the systematic decoding of cell-cell communication has received great research interest. To date, several in-silico methods have been developed, but most of them lack the ability to predict the communication pathways connecting the insides and outsides of cells. Here, we developed CellCall, a toolkit to infer inter- and intracellular communication pathways by integrating paired ligand-receptor and transcription factor (TF) activity. Moreover, CellCall uses an embedded pathway activity analysis method to identify the significantly activated pathways involved in intercellular crosstalk between certain cell types. Additionally, CellCall offers a rich suite of visualization options (Circos plot, Sankey plot, bubble plot, ridge plot, etc.) to present the analysis results. Case studies on scRNA-seq datasets of human testicular cells and the tumor immune microenvironment demonstrated the reliable and unique functionality of CellCall in intercellular communication analysis and internal TF activity exploration, which were further validated experimentally. Comparative analysis of CellCall and other tools indicated that CellCall was more accurate and offered more functions. In summary, CellCall provides a sophisticated and practical tool allowing researchers to decipher intercellular communication and related internal regulatory signals based on scRNA-seq data.

10.1093/nar/gkab745	FALSE	FALSE	SPaRTAN, a computational framework for linking cell-surface receptors to transcriptional regulators	2021-09-09	The identity and functions of specialized cell types are dependent on the complex interplay between signaling and transcriptional networks. Recently single-cell technologies have been developed that enable simultaneous quantitative analysis of cell-surface receptor expression with transcriptional states. To date, these datasets have not been used to systematically develop cell-context-specific maps of the interface between signaling and transcriptional regulators orchestrating cellular identity and function. We present SPaRTAN (Single-cell Proteomic and RNA based Transcription factor Activity Network), a computational method to link cell-surface receptors to transcription factors (TFs) by exploiting cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) datasets with cis-regulatory information. SPaRTAN is applied to immune cell types in the blood to predict the coupling of signaling receptors with cell context-specific TFs. Selected predictions are validated by prior knowledge and flow cytometry analyses. SPaRTAN is then used to predict the signaling coupled TF states of tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells in malignant peritoneal and pleural mesotheliomas. SPaRTAN enhances the utility of CITE-seq datasets to uncover TF and cell-surface receptor relationships in diverse cellular states.	17	0.04654346338124572	6	68	0	0	NA
10.1093/nar/gkab775	FALSE	FALSE	scDeepSort: a pre-trained cell-type annotation method for single-cell transcriptomics using deep learning with a weighted graph neural network	2021-09-09	Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have furthered the simultaneous classification of thousands of cells in a single assay based on transcriptome profiling. In most analysis protocols, single-cell type annotation relies on marker genes or RNA-seq profiles, resulting in poor extrapolation. Still, the accurate cell-type annotation for single-cell transcriptomic data remains a great challenge. Here, we introduce scDeepSort (https://github.com/ZJUFanLab/scDeepSort), a pre-trained cell-type annotation tool for single-cell transcriptomics that uses a deep learning model with a weighted graph neural network (GNN). Using human and mouse scRNA-seq data resources, we demonstrate the high performance and robustness of scDeepSort in labeling 764 741 cells involving 56 human and 32 mouse tissues. Significantly, scDeepSort outperformed other known methods in annotating 76 external test datasets, reaching an 83.79% accuracy across 265 489 cells in humans and mice. Moreover, we demonstrate the universality of scDeepSort using more challenging datasets and using references from different scRNA-seq technology. Above all, scDeepSort is the first attempt to annotate cell types of scRNA-seq data with a pre-trained GNN model, which can realize the accurate cell-type annotation without additional references, i.e. markers or RNA-seq profiles.	17	0.04654346338124572	9	49	0	0	10.08

10.1093/nar/gkz488	FALSE	FALSE	Learning common and specific patterns from data of multiple interrelated biological scenarios with matrix factorization	2019-06-08	High-throughput biological technologies (e.g. ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq) rapidly accelerate the accumulation of genome-wide omics data in diverse interrelated biological scenarios (e.g. cells, tissues and conditions). Integration and differential analysis are two common paradigms for exploring and analyzing such data. However, current integrative methods usually ignore the differential part, and typical differential analysis methods either fail to identify combinatorial patterns of difference or require matched dimensions of the data. Here, we propose a flexible framework CSMF to combine them into one paradigm to simultaneously reveal Common and Specific patterns via Matrix Factorization from data generated under interrelated biological scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CSMF with four representative applications including pairwise ChIP-seq data describing the chromatin modification map between K562 and Huvec cell lines; pairwise RNA-seq data representing the expression profiles of two different cancers; RNA-seq data of three breast cancer subtypes; and single-cell RNA-seq data of human embryonic stem cell differentiation at six time points. Extensive analysis yields novel insights into hidden combinatorial patterns in these multi-modal data. Results demonstrate that CSMF is a powerful tool to uncover common and specific patterns with significant biological implications from data of interrelated biological scenarios.	841	2.302532511978097	2	52	9	0.01070154577883472	2.25
10.1093/nar/gkz543	FALSE	FALSE	CHETAH: a selective, hierarchical cell type identification method for single-cell RNA sequencing	2019-06-21	Cell type identification is essential for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies, currently transforming the life sciences. CHETAH (CHaracterization of cEll Types Aided by Hierarchical classification) is an accurate cell type identification algorithm that is rapid and selective, including the possibility of intermediate or unassigned categories. Evidence for assignment is based on a classification tree of previously available scRNA-seq reference data and includes a confidence score based on the variance in gene expression per cell type. For cell types represented in the reference data, CHETAH’s accuracy is as good as existing methods. Its specificity is superior when cells of an unknown type are encountered, such as malignant cells in tumor samples which it pinpoints as intermediate or unassigned. Although designed for tumor samples in particular, the use of unassigned and intermediate types is also valuable in other exploratory studies. This is exemplified in pancreas datasets where CHETAH highlights cell populations not well represented in the reference dataset, including cells with profiles that lie on a continuum between that of acinar and ductal cell types. Having the possibility of unassigned and intermediate cell types is pivotal for preventing misclassification and can yield important biological information for previously unexplored tissues.	828	2.2669404517453797	5	59	58	0.07004830917874397	11.35

10.1093/nar/gkz622	FALSE	FALSE	Nonparametric expression analysis using inferential replicate counts	2019-08-02	A primary challenge in the analysis of RNA-seq data is to identify differentially expressed genes or transcripts while controlling for technical biases. Ideally, a statistical testing procedure should incorporate the inherent uncertainty of the abundance estimates arising from the quantification step. Most popular methods for RNA-seq differential expression analysis fit a parametric model to the counts for each gene or transcript, and a subset of methods can incorporate uncertainty. Previous work has shown that nonparametric models for RNA-seq differential expression may have better control of the false discovery rate, and adapt well to new data types without requiring reformulation of a parametric model. Existing nonparametric models do not take into account inferential uncertainty, leading to an inflated false discovery rate, in particular at the transcript level. We propose a nonparametric model for differential expression analysis using inferential replicate counts, extending the existing SAMseq method to account for inferential uncertainty. We compare our method, Swish, with popular differential expression analysis methods. Swish has improved control of the false discovery rate, in particular for transcripts with high inferential uncertainty. We apply Swish to a single-cell RNA-seq dataset, assessing differential expression between sub-populations of cells, and compare its performance to the Wilcoxon test.	786	2.1519507186858315	5	56	13	0.01653944020356234	39.58
10.1093/nar/gkz655	FALSE	FALSE	LTMG: a novel statistical modeling of transcriptional expression states in single-cell RNA-Seq data	2019-08-02	A key challenge in modeling single-cell RNA-seq data is to capture the diversity of gene expression states regulated by different transcriptional regulatory inputs across individual cells, which is further complicated by largely observed zero and low expressions. We developed a left truncated mixture Gaussian (LTMG) model, from the kinetic relationships of the transcriptional regulatory inputs, mRNA metabolism and abundance in single cells. LTMG infers the expression multi-modalities across single cells, meanwhile, the dropouts and low expressions are treated as left truncated. We demonstrated that LTMG has significantly better goodness of fitting on an extensive number of scRNA-seq data, comparing to three other state-of-the-art models. Our biological assumption of the low non-zero expressions, rationality of the multimodality setting, and the capability of LTMG in extracting expression states specific to cell types or functions, are validated on independent experimental data sets. A differential gene expression test and a co-regulation module identification method are further developed. We experimentally validated that our differential expression test has higher sensitivity and specificity, compared with other five popular methods. The co-regulation analysis is capable of retrieving gene co-regulation modules corresponding to perturbed transcriptional regulations. A user-friendly R package with all the analysis power is available at https://github.com/zy26/LTMGSCA.	786	2.1519507186858315	11	51	23	0.029262086513994912	13.68

It has become possible to track the trajectory of thousands of genes across the cellular lineage trees that represent the temporal emergence of cell types during dynamic processes. However, reconstruction of cellular lineage trees with more than a few cell fates has proved challenging. We present MERLoT (https://github.com/soedinglab/merlot), a flexible and user-friendly tool to reconstruct complex lineage trees from single-cell transcriptomics data. It can impute temporal gene expression profiles along the reconstructed tree. We show MERLoT’s capabilities on various real cases and hundreds of simulated datasets.	768	2.102669404517454	8	30	11	0.014322916666666666	15.73
10.1093/nar/gkz716	FALSE	FALSE	Global prediction of chromatin accessibility using small-cell-number and single-cell RNA-seq	2019-08-20	Conventional high-throughput genomic technologies for mapping regulatory element activities in bulk samples such as ChIP-seq, DNase-seq and FAIRE-seq cannot analyze samples with small numbers of cells. The recently developed low-input and single-cell regulome mapping technologies such as ATAC-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) allow analyses of small-cell-number and single-cell samples, but their signals remain highly discrete or noisy. Compared to these regulome mapping technologies, transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq is more widely used. Transcriptome data in single-cell and small-cell-number samples are more continuous and often less noisy. Here, we show that one can globally predict chromatin accessibility and infer regulatory element activities using RNA-seq. Genome-wide chromatin accessibility predicted by RNA-seq from 30 cells can offer better accuracy than ATAC-seq from 500 cells. Predictions based on single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) can more accurately reconstruct bulk chromatin accessibility than using scATAC-seq. Integrating ATAC-seq with predictions from RNA-seq increases the power and value of both methods. Thus, transcriptome-based prediction provides a new tool for decoding gene regulatory circuitry in samples with limited cell numbers.	768	2.102669404517454	4	39	11	0.014322916666666666	4.85
10.1093/nar/gkz781	FALSE	FALSE	Cell-type-specific analysis of alternative polyadenylation using single-cell transcriptomics data	2019-09-10	Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is emerging as an important layer of gene regulation because the majority of mammalian protein-coding genes contain multiple polyadenylation (pA) sites in their 3′ UTR. By alteration of 3′ UTR length, APA can considerably affect post-transcriptional gene regulation. Yet, our understanding of APA remains rudimentary. Novel single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques allow molecular characterization of different cell types to an unprecedented degree. Notably, the most popular scRNA-seq protocols specifically sequence the 3′ end of transcripts. Building on this property, we implemented a method for analysing patterns of APA regulation from such data. Analyzing multiple datasets from diverse tissues, we identified widespread modulation of APA in different cell types resulting in global 3′ UTR shortening/lengthening and enhanced cleavage at intronic pA sites. Our results provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that the huge volume of scRNA-seq data that accumulates in the public domain offers a unique resource for the exploration of APA based on a very broad collection of cell types and biological conditions.	747	2.0451745379876796	2	66	30	0.040160642570281124	13.03
10.1093/nar/gkz789	FALSE	FALSE	cellHarmony: cell-level matching and holistic comparison of single-cell transcriptomes	2019-09-16	To understand the molecular pathogenesis of human disease, precision analyses to define alterations within and between disease-associated cell populations are desperately needed. Single-cell genomics represents an ideal platform to enable the identification and comparison of normal and diseased transcriptional cell populations. We created cellHarmony, an integrated solution for the unsupervised analysis, classification, and comparison of cell types from diverse single-cell RNA-Seq datasets. cellHarmony efficiently and accurately matches single-cell transcriptomes using a community-clustering and alignment strategy to compute differences in cell-type specific gene expression over potentially dozens of cell populations. Such transcriptional differences are used to automatically identify distinct and shared gene programs among cell-types and identify impacted pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks to understand the impact of perturbations at a systems level. cellHarmony is implemented as a python package and as an integrated workflow within the software AltAnalyze. We demonstrate that cellHarmony has improved or equivalent performance to alternative label projection methods, is able to identify the likely cellular origins of malignant states, stratify patients into clinical disease subtypes from identified gene programs, resolve discrete disease networks impacting specific cell-types, and illuminate therapeutic mechanisms. Thus, this approach holds tremendous promise in revealing the molecular and cellular origins of complex disease.	741	2.028747433264887	10	50	25	0.033738191632928474	15.68
10.1093/nar/gkz826	FALSE	FALSE	Latent cellular analysis robustly reveals subtle diversity in large-scale single-cell RNA-seq data	2019-09-30	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for characterizing the cell-to-cell variation and cellular dynamics in populations which appear homogeneous otherwise in basic and translational biological research. However, significant challenges arise in the analysis of scRNA-seq data, including the low signal-to-noise ratio with high data sparsity, potential batch effects, scalability problems when hundreds of thousands of cells are to be analyzed among others. The inherent complexities of scRNA-seq data and dynamic nature of cellular processes lead to suboptimal performance of many currently available algorithms, even for basic tasks such as identifying biologically meaningful heterogeneous subpopulations. In this study, we developed the Latent Cellular Analysis (LCA), a machine learning–based analytical pipeline that combines cosine-similarity measurement by latent cellular states with a graph-based clustering algorithm. LCA provides heuristic solutions for population number inference, dimension reduction, feature selection, and control of technical variations without explicit gene filtering. We show that LCA is robust, accurate, and powerful by comparison with multiple state-of-the-art computational methods when applied to large-scale real and simulated scRNA-seq data. Importantly, the ability of LCA to learn from representative subsets of the data provides scalability, thereby addressing a significant challenge posed by growing sample sizes in scRNA-seq data analysis.	727	1.9904175222450375	10	37	7	0.009628610729023384	NA
10.1093/nargab/lqaa025	FALSE	FALSE	Single-Cell Virtual Cytometer allows user-friendly and versatile analysis and visualization of multimodal single cell RNAseq datasets	2020-04-20	The development of single-cell transcriptomic technologies yields large datasets comprising multimodal informations, such as transcriptomes and immunophenotypes. Despite the current explosion of methods for pre-processing and integrating multimodal single-cell data, there is currently no user-friendly software to display easily and simultaneously both immunophenotype and transcriptome-based UMAP/t-SNE plots from the pre-processed data. Here, we introduce Single-Cell Virtual Cytometer, an open-source software for flow cytometry-like visualization and exploration of pre-processed multi-omics single cell datasets. Using an original CITE-seq dataset of PBMC from an healthy donor, we illustrate its use for the integrated analysis of transcriptomes and epitopes of functional maturation in human peripheral T lymphocytes. So this free and open-source algorithm constitutes a unique resource for biologists seeking for a user-friendly analytic tool for multimodal single cell datasets.	524	1.434633812457221	10	21	5	0.009541984732824428	0.5

A crucial step in analyzing scRNA-seq data is to cluster cells into subpopulations to facilitate subsequent downstream analysis. However, frequent dropout events and increasing size of scRNA-seq data make clustering such high-dimensional, sparse and massive transcriptional expression profiles challenging. Although some existing deep learning-based clustering algorithms for single cells combine dimensionality reduction with clustering, they either ignore the distance and affinity constraints between similar cells or make some additional latent space assumptions like mixture Gaussian distribution, failing to learn cluster-friendly low-dimensional space. Therefore, in this paper, we combine the deep learning technique with the use of a denoising autoencoder to characterize scRNA-seq data while propose a soft self-training K-means algorithm to cluster the cell population in the learned latent space. The self-training procedure can effectively aggregate the similar cells and pursue more cluster-friendly latent space. Our method, called ‘scziDesk’, alternately performs data compression, data reconstruction and soft clustering iteratively, and the results exhibit excellent compatibility and robustness in both simulated and real data. Moreover, our proposed method has perfect scalability in line with cell size on large-scale datasets.	489	1.3388090349075976	4	53	6	0.012269938650306749	NA
10.1093/nargab/lqaa059	FALSE	FALSE	Normalizing single-cell RNA sequencing data with internal spike-in-like genes	2020-08-18	Normalization with respect to sequencing depth is a crucial step in single-cell RNA sequencing preprocessing. Most methods normalize data using the whole transcriptome based on the assumption that the majority of transcriptome remains constant and are unable to detect drastic changes of the transcriptome. Here, we develop an algorithm based on a small fraction of constantly expressed genes as internal spike-ins to normalize single-cell RNA sequencing data. We demonstrate that the transcriptome of single cells may undergo drastic changes in several case study datasets and accounting for such heterogeneity by ISnorm (Internal Spike-in-like-genes normalization) improves the performance of downstream analyses.	404	1.106091718001369	6	37	3	0.007425742574257425	0.75
10.1093/nargab/lqaa077	FALSE	FALSE	SIMPLEs: a single-cell RNA sequencing imputation strategy preserving gene modules and cell clusters variation	2020-09-28	A main challenge in analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is to reduce technical variations yet retain cell heterogeneity. Due to low mRNAs content per cell and molecule losses during the experiment (called ‘dropout’), the gene expression matrix has a substantial amount of zero read counts. Existing imputation methods treat either each cell or each gene as independently and identically distributed, which oversimplifies the gene correlation and cell type structure. We propose a statistical model-based approach, called SIMPLEs (SIngle-cell RNA-seq iMPutation and celL clustErings), which iteratively identifies correlated gene modules and cell clusters and imputes dropouts customized for individual gene module and cell type. Simultaneously, it quantifies the uncertainty of imputation and cell clustering via multiple imputations. In simulations, SIMPLEs performed significantly better than prevailing scRNA-seq imputation methods according to various metrics. By applying SIMPLEs to several real datasets, we discovered gene modules that can further classify subtypes of cells. Our imputations successfully recovered the expression trends of marker genes in stem cell differentiation and can discover putative pathways regulating biological processes.	363	0.9938398357289527	3	39	0	0	1.25
10.1093/nargab/lqaa082	FALSE	FALSE	scAIDE: clustering of large-scale single-cell RNA-seq data reveals putative and rare cell types	2020-10-09	Recent advancements in both single-cell RNA-sequencing technology and computational resources facilitate the study of cell types on global populations. Up to millions of cells can now be sequenced in one experiment; thus, accurate and efficient computational methods are needed to provide clustering and post-analysis of assigning putative and rare cell types. Here, we present a novel unsupervised deep learning clustering framework that is robust and highly scalable. To overcome the high level of noise, scAIDE first incorporates an autoencoder-imputation network with a distance-preserved embedding network (AIDE) to learn a good representation of data, and then applies a random projection hashing based k-means algorithm to accommodate the detection of rare cell types. We analyzed a 1.3 million neural cell dataset within 30 min, obtaining 64 clusters which were mapped to 19 putative cell types. In particular, we further identified three different neural stem cell developmental trajectories in these clusters. We also classified two subpopulations of malignant cells in a small glioblastoma dataset using scAIDE. We anticipate that scAIDE would provide a more in-depth understanding of cell development and diseases.	352	0.9637234770704997	5	55	3	0.008522727272727272	NA
10.1093/nargab/lqab011	FALSE	FALSE	Single-cell mapper (scMappR): using scRNA-seq to infer the cell-type specificities of differentially expressed genes	2021-02-23	RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is widely used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and reveal biological mechanisms underlying complex biological processes. RNA-seq is often performed on heterogeneous samples and the resulting DEGs do not necessarily indicate the cell-types where the differential expression occurred. While single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) methods solve this problem, technical and cost constraints currently limit its widespread use. Here we present single cell Mapper (scMappR), a method that assigns cell-type specificity scores to DEGs obtained from bulk RNA-seq by leveraging cell-type expression data generated by scRNA-seq and existing deconvolution methods. After evaluating scMappR with simulated RNA-seq data and benchmarking scMappR using RNA-seq data obtained from sorted blood cells, we asked if scMappR could reveal known cell-type specific changes that occur during kidney regeneration. scMappR appropriately assigned DEGs to cell-types involved in kidney regeneration, including a relatively small population of immune cells. While scMappR can work with user-supplied scRNA-seq data, we curated scRNA-seq expression matrices for ∼100 human and mouse tissues to facilitate its stand-alone use with bulk RNA-seq data from these species. Overall, scMappR is a user-friendly R package that complements traditional differential gene expression analysis of bulk RNA-seq data.	215	0.5886379192334018	9	79	2	0.009302325581395349	23.296
10.1093/nargab/lqz020	FALSE	FALSE	An NMF-based approach to discover overlooked differentially expressed gene regions from single-cell RNA-seq data	2019-12-16	Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled researchers to quantify the transcriptomes of individual cells, infer cell types and investigate differential expression among cell types, which will lead to a better understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of cell states. Transcript diversity caused by phenomena such as aberrant splicing events have been revealed, and differential expression of previously unannotated transcripts might be overlooked by annotation-based analyses. Accordingly, we have developed an approach to discover overlooked differentially expressed (DE) gene regions that complements annotation-based methods. Our algorithm decomposes mapped count data matrix for a gene region using non-negative matrix factorization, quantifies the differential expression level based on the decomposed matrix, and compares the differential expression level based on annotation-based approach to discover previously unannotated DE transcripts. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing for human neural stem cells and applied our algorithm to the dataset. We also applied our algorithm to two public single-cell RNA sequencing datasets correspond to mouse ES and primitive endoderm cells, and human preimplantation embryos. As a result, we discovered several intriguing DE transcripts, including a transcript related to the modulation of neural stem/progenitor cell differentiation.	650	1.7796030116358659	9	51	3	0.004615384615384616	15.4

10.1101/014472	FALSE	TRUE	Sincell: Bioconductor package for the statistical assessment of cell-state hierarchies from single-cell RNA-seq data	2015-01-27	Summary: Cell differentiation processes are achieved through a continuum of hierarchical intermediate cell-states that might be captured by single-cell RNA seq. Existing computational approaches for the assessment of cell-state hierarchies from single-cell data might be formalized under a general framework composed of i) a metric to assess cell-to-cell similarities (combined or not with a dimensionality reduction step), and ii) a graph-building algorithm (optionally making use of a cells-clustering step). Sincell R package implements a methodological toolbox allowing flexible workflows under such framework. Furthermore, Sincell contributes new algo-rithms to provide cell-state hierarchies with statistical support while accounting for stochastic factors in single-cell RNA seq. Graphical representations and functional association tests are provided to interpret hierarchies. Sincell functionalities are illustrated in a real case study where its ability to discriminate noisy from stable cell-state hierarchies is demonstrated. Availability and implementation: Sincell is an open-source R/Bioconductor package available at http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.1/bioc/html/sincell.html.

10.1101/019588	FALSE	TRUE	Pseudotime estimation: deconfounding single cell time series	2015-05-21	Cross-sectional time series single cell data confound several sources of variation, with contributions from measurement noise, stochastic cell to cell variation and cell progression at different rates. Time series from single cell assays are particularly susceptible to confounding as the measurements are not averaged over populations of cells. When several genes are assayed in parallel these effects can be estimated and corrected for under certain smoothness assumptions on cell progression. We present a principled probabilistic model with a Bayesian inference scheme to analyse such data. We demonstrate our method's utility on public microarray, nCounter and RNA-seq data sets from three organisms. Our method almost perfectly recovers withheld capture times in an Arabidopsis data set, it accurately estimates cell cycle peak times in a human prostate cancer cell line and it correctly identifies two precocious cells in a study of paracrine signalling in mouse dendritic cells. Furthermore, our method compares favourably with Monocle, a state-of-the-art technique. We also show using held out data that uncertainty in the temporal dimension is a common confounder and should be accounted for in analyses of cross-sectional time series.	2320	6.351813826146475	2	0	5	0.0021551724137931034	2.75
10.1101/020735	FALSE	TRUE	Discrete Distributional Differential Expression (D3E) - A Tool for Gene Expression Analysis of Single-cell RNA-seq Data	2015-06-10	The advent of high throughput RNA-seq at the single-cell level has opened up new opportunities to elucidate the heterogeneity of gene expression. One of the most widespread applications of RNA-seq is to identify genes which are differentially expressed (DE) between two experimental conditions. Here, we present a discrete, distributional method for differential gene expression (D3E), a novel algorithm specifically designed for single-cell RNA-seq data. We use synthetic data to evaluate D3E, demonstrating that it can detect changes in expression, even when the mean level remains unchanged. D3E is based on an analytically tractable stochastic model, and thus it provides additional biological insights by quantifying biologically meaningful properties, such as the average burst size and frequency. We use D3E to investigate experimental data, and with the help of the underlying model, we directly test hypotheses about the driving mechanism behind changes in gene expression.	2300	6.297056810403833	2	0	2	8.695652173913044e-4	20.276
10.1101/020842	FALSE	TRUE	MAST: A flexible statistical framework for assessing transcriptional changes and characterizing heterogeneity in single-cell RNA-seq data.	2015-06-15	Single-cell transcriptomic profiling enables the unprecedented interrogation of gene expression heterogeneity in rare cell populations that would otherwise be obscured in bulk RNA sequencing experiments. The stochastic nature of transcription is revealed in the bimodality of single-cell transcriptomic data, a feature shared across single-cell expression platforms. There is, however, a paucity of computational tools that take advantage of this unique characteristic. We present a new methodology to analyze single-cell transcriptomic data that models this bimodality within a coherent generalized linear modeling framework. We propose a two-part, generalized linear model that allows one to characterize biological changes in the proportions of cells that are expressing each gene, and in the positive mean expression level of that gene. We introduce the cellular detection rate, the fraction of genes turned on in a cell, and show how it can be used to simultaneously adjust for technical variation and so-called “extrinsic noise” at the single-cell level without the use of control genes. Our model permits direct inference on statistics formed by collections of genes, facilitating gene set enrichment analysis. The residuals defined by such models can be manipulated to interrogate cellular heterogeneity and gene-gene correlation across cells and conditions, providing insights into the temporal evolution of networks of co-expressed genes at the single-cell level. Using two single-cell RNA-seq datasets, including newly generated data from Mucosal Associated Invariant T (MAIT) cells, we show how model residuals can be used to identify significant changes across biologically relevant gene sets that are missed by other methods and characterize cellular heterogeneity in response to stimulation.	2295	6.283367556468172	12	0	4	0.0017429193899782135	13.12

Salmon is the first transcriptome-wide quantifier to model and correct for fragment GC content bias, which we demonstrate substantially improves the accuracy of abundance estimates and the reliability of subsequent differential expression analysis compared to existing methods that do not account for these biases. Salmon achieves its speed and accuracy by combining a new dual-phase parallel inference algorithm and feature-rich bias models with an ultra-fast read mapping procedure. These innovations yield both exceptional accuracy and order-of-magnitude speed benefits over alignment-based methods.	2283	6.250513347022587	5	28	82	0.03591765221200175	130.18

In contrast to previous implementations, we further present an efficient nearest-neighbour approximation that allows for the processing of hundreds of thousands of cells and a functionality for projecting new data on existing diffusion maps.

Specifically, Leng* et al. showed significantly increased gene expression in cells captured from sites with small or large plate output IDs. We refer to this artifact as an ordering effect (OE). Including OE genes in downstream analyses could lead to biased results. To address this problem, we developed a statistical method and software called OEFinder to identify a sorted list of OE genes. OEFinder is available as an R package along with user-friendly graphical interface implementations that allows users to check for potential artifacts in scRNA-seq data generated by the Fluidigm C1 platform.	2224	6.0889801505817935	6	0	1	4.496402877697842e-4	10.846
10.1101/026385	FALSE	TRUE	pcaReduce: Hierarchical Clustering of Single Cell Transcriptional Profiles	2015-09-08	Advances in single cell genomics provides a way of routinely generating transcriptomics data at the single cell level. A frequent requirement of single cell expression experiments is the identification of novel patterns of heterogeneity across single cells that might explain complex cellular states or tissue composition. To date, classical statistical analysis tools have being routinely applied to single cell data, but there is considerable scope for the development of novel statistical approaches that are better adapted to the challenges of inferring cellular hierarchies. Here, we present a novel integration of principal components analysis and hierarchi- cal clustering to create a framework for characterising cell state identity. Our methodology uses agglomerative clustering to generate a cell state hierarchy where each cluster branch is associated with a principal component of variation that can be used to differentiate two cellular states. We demonstrate that using real single cell datasets this approach allows for consistent clustering of single cell transcriptional profiles across multiple scales of interpretation.

10.1101/026948	FALSE	TRUE	Characterizing transcriptional heterogeneity through pathway and gene set overdispersion analysis	2015-09-16	Single-cell transcriptome measurements are being applied at rapidly increasing scales to study cellular repertoires underpinning functions of complex tissues and organs, including mammalian brains. The transcriptional state of each cell, however, reflects a variety of biological factors, including persistent cell-type specific regulatory configurations, transient processes such as cell cycle, local metabolic demands, and extracellular signals. Depending on the biological setting, all such aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity can be of potential interest, but detecting complex heterogeneity structure from inherently uncertain single-cell data presents analytical challenges. We developed PAGODA to resolve multiple, potentially overlapping aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity by identifying known pathways or novel gene sets that show significant excess of coordinated variability among the measured cells. We demonstrate that PAGODA effectively recovers the subpopulations and their corresponding functional characteristics in a variety of single-cell samples, and use it to characterize transcriptional diversity of neuronal progenitors in the developing mouse cortex	2202	6.028747433264887	11	0	3	0.0013623978201634877	3.85

However, such data offers only a snapshot of the transcriptome, whereas it is often the progression of cells through dynamic biological processes that is of interest. As a result, one outstanding challenge is to infer such progressions by ordering gene expression from single cell data alone, known as the cell ordering problem. Here, we introduce a new method that constructs a low-dimensional non-linear embedding of the data using laplacian eigenmaps before assigning each cell a pseudotime using principal curves. We characterise why on a theoretical level our method is more robust to the high levels of noise typical of single-cell RNA-seq data before demonstrating its utility on two existing datasets of differentiating cells.	2200	6.023271731690623	3	0	20	0.00909090909090909	14.08

Although understanding such heterogeneity is of primary interest in a number of studies, for convenience, statistical methods often treat cellular heterogeneity as a nuisance factor. We present a novel method to characterize differences in expression in the presence of distinct expression states within and among biological conditions. Using simulated and case study data, we demonstrate that the modeling framework is able to detect differential expression patterns of interest under a wide range of settings. Compared to existing approaches, scDD has higher power to detect subtle differences in gene expression distributions that are more complex than a mean shift, and is able to characterize those differences. The freely available R package scDD implements the approach.	2098	5.7440109514031485	7	67	5	0.0023832221163012394	20.776
10.1101/035808	FALSE	TRUE	Genome-wide Prediction of DNase I Hypersensitivity Using Gene Expression	2016-01-01	We evaluate the feasibility of using a biological sample’s transcriptome to predict its genome-wide regulatory element activities measured by DNase I hypersensitivity (DH). We develop BIRD, Big Data Regression for predicting DH, to handle this high-dimensional problem. Applying BIRD to the Encyclopedia of DNA Element (ENCODE) data, we found that gene expression to a large extent predicts DH, and information useful for prediction is contained in the whole transcriptome rather than limited to a regulatory element’s neighboring genes. We show that the predicted DH predicts transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), prediction models trained using ENCODE data can be applied to gene expression samples in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to predict regulome, and one can use predictions as pseudo-replicates to improve the analysis of high-throughput regulome profiling data. Besides improving our understanding of the regulome-transcriptome relationship, this study suggests that transcriptome-based prediction can provide a useful new approach for regulome mapping.	2095	5.735797399041752	6	0	0	0	14.2
10.1101/035816	FALSE	TRUE	Global Prediction of Chromatin Accessibility Using RNA-seq from Small Number of Cells	2016-01-01	Conventional high-throughput technologies for mapping regulatory element activities such as ChIP-seq, DNase-seq and FAIRE-seq cannot analyze samples with small number of cells. The recently developed ATAC-seq allows regulome mapping in small-cell-number samples, but its signal in single cell or samples with ≤500 cells remains discrete or noisy. Compared to these technologies, measuring transcriptome by RNA-seq in single-cell and small-cell-number samples is more mature. Here we show that one can globally predict chromatin accessibility and infer regulome using RNA-seq. Genome-wide chromatin accessibility predicted by RNA-seq from 30 cells is comparable with ATAC-seq from 500 cells. Predictions based on single-cell RNA-seq can more accurately reconstruct bulk chromatin accessibility than using single-cell ATAC-seq by pooling the same number of cells. Integrating ATAC-seq with predictions from RNA-seq increases power of both methods. Thus, transcriptome-based prediction can provide a new tool for decoding gene regulatory programs in small-cell-number samples.	2095	5.735797399041752	3	0	2	9.546539379474941e-4	20.446
10.1101/035949	FALSE	TRUE	Beyond comparisons of means: understanding changes in gene expression at the single-cell level	2016-01-05	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be used to characterise differences in gene expression patterns between pre-specified populations of cells. Traditionally, differential expression tools are restricted to the study of changes in overall expression between cell populations. However, such analyses do not take full advantage of the rich information provided by scRNA-seq. In this article, we present a Bayesian hierarchical model which can be used to study changes in expression that lie beyond comparisons of means. In particular, our method can highlight genes that undergo changes in cell-to-cell heterogeneity between the populations but whose overall expression is preserved. Evidence supporting these changes is quantified using a probabilistic approach based on tail posterior probabilities, where a probability cut-off is calibrated through the expected false discovery rate. Our method incorporates a built-in normalisation strategy and quantifies technical artefacts by borrowing information from technical spike-in genes. Control experiments validate the performance of our approach. Finally, we compare expression patterns of mouse embryonic stem cells between different stages of the cell cycle, revealing substantial differences in cellular heterogeneity.	2091	5.724845995893224	3	0	0	0	18.08
10.1101/036533	FALSE	TRUE	Robust Lineage Reconstruction from High-Dimensional Single-Cell Data	2016-01-12	Single-cell gene expression data provide invaluable resources for systematic characterization of cellular hierarchy in multi-cellular organisms. However, cell lineage reconstruction is still often associated with significant uncertainty due to technological constraints. Such uncertainties have not been taken into account in current methods. We present ECLAIR, a novel computational method for the statistical inference of cell lineage relationships from single-cell gene expression data. ECLAIR uses an ensemble approach to improve the robustness of lineage predictions, and provides a quantitative estimate of the uncertainty of lineage branchings. We show that the application of ECLAIR to published datasets successfully reconstructs known lineage relationships and significantly improves the robustness of predictions. In conclusion, ECLAIR is a powerful bioinformatics tool for single-cell data analysis. It can be used for robust lineage reconstruction with quantitative estimate of prediction accuracy.	2084	5.705681040383299	4	0	0	0	2.75
10.1101/036558	FALSE	TRUE	SC3 - consensus clustering of single-cell RNA-Seq data	2016-01-13	Using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), the full transcriptome of individual cells can be acquired, enabling a quantitative cell-type characterisation based on expression profiles. However, due to the large variability in gene expression, identifying cell types based on the transcriptome remains challenging. We present Single-Cell Consensus Clustering (SC3), a tool for unsupervised clustering of scRNA-seq data. SC3 achieves high accuracy and robustness by consistently integrating different clustering solutions through a consensus approach. Tests on twelve published datasets show that SC3 outperforms five existing methods while remaining scalable, as shown by the analysis of a large dataset containing 44,808 cells. Moreover, an interactive graphical implementation makes SC3 accessible to a wide audience of users, and SC3 aids biological interpretation by identifying marker genes, differentially expressed genes and outlier cells. We illustrate the capabilities of SC3 by characterising newly obtained transcriptomes from subclones of neoplastic cells collected from patients.	2083	5.702943189596167	11	66	31	0.014882381180988958	23.876
10.1101/036988	FALSE	TRUE	Isoform-level gene expression patterns in single-cell RNA-sequencing data	2016-01-16	RNA-sequencing of single-cells enables characterization of transcriptional heterogeneity in seemingly homogenous cell populations. In this study we propose and apply a novel method, ISOform-Patterns (ISOP), based on mixture modeling, to characterize the expression patterns of pairs of isoforms from the same gene in single-cell isoform-level expression data. We define six principal patterns of isoform expression relationships and introduce the concept of differential pattern analysis. We applied ISOP for analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data from a breast cancer cell line, with replication in two independent datasets. In the primary dataset we detected and assigned pattern type of 16562 isoform-pairs from 4929 genes. Our results showed that 78% of the isoform pairs displayed a mutually exclusive expression pattern, 14% of the isoform pairs displayed bimodal isoform preference and 8% isoform pairs displayed isoform preference. 26% of the isoform-pair patterns were significant, while remaining isoform-pair patterns can be understood as effects of transcriptional bursting, drop-out and biological heterogeneity. 32% of genes discovered through differential pattern analysis were novel and not detected by differential expression analysis. ISOP provides a novel approach for characterization of isoform-level expression in single-cell populations. Our results reveal a common occurrence of isoform-level preference, commitment and heterogeneity in single-cell populations.	2080	5.69472963723477	7	0	0	0	9.596

We describe an efficient way to robustly estimate this order according to a diffusion pseudotime, which measures transitions on all length scales between cells using diffusion-like random walks. This allows us to identify cells that undergo branching decisions or are in metastable states, and thereby genes differentially regulated at these states.	2036	5.574264202600959	5	26	16	0.007858546168958742	4.5
10.1101/045070	FALSE	TRUE	Controlling for confounding effects in single cell RNA sequencing studies using both control and target genes	2016-03-22	Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) technique is becoming increasingly popular for unbiased and high-resolutional transcriptome analysis of heterogeneous cell populations. Despite its many advantages, scRNAseq, like any other genomic sequencing technique, is susceptible to the influence of confounding effects. Controlling for confounding effects in scRNAseq data is thus a crucial step for proper data normalization and accurate downstream analysis. Several recent methodological studies have demonstrated the use of control genes for controlling for confounding effects in scRNAseq studies; the control genes are used to infer the confounding effects, which are then used to normalize target genes of primary interest. However, these methods can be suboptimal as they ignore the rich information contained in the target genes. Here, we develop an alternative statistical method, which we refer to as scPLS, for more accurate inference of confounding effects. Our method is based on partial least squares and models control and target genes jointly to better infer and control for confounding effects. To accompany our method, we develop a novel expectation maximization algorithm for scalable inference. Our algorithm is an order of magnitude faster than standard ones, making scPLS applicable to hundreds of cells and hundreds of thousands of genes. With extensive simulations and comparisons with other methods, we demonstrate the effectiveness of scPLS. Finally, we apply scPLS to analyze two scRNAseq data sets to illustrate its benefits in removing technical confounding effects as well as for removing cell cycle effects.	2014	5.514031485284052	2	0	0	0	16.6
10.1101/046110	FALSE	TRUE	SCPattern: A statistical approach to identify and classify expression changes in single cell RNA-seq experiments with ordered conditions	2016-03-29	With the development of single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology, scRNA-seq experiments with ordered conditions (e.g. time-course) are becoming common. Methods developed for analyzing ordered bulk RNA-seq experiments are not applicable to scRNA-seq, since their distributional assumptions are often violated by additional heterogeneities prevalent in scRNA-seq. Here we present SC-Pattern - an empirical Bayes model to characterize genes with expression changes in ordered scRNA-seq experiments. SCPattern utilizes the non-parametrical Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, thus it has the flexibility to identify genes with a wide variety of types of changes. Additionally, the Bayes framework allows SCPattern to classify genes into expression patterns with probability estimates.Simulation results show that SCPattern is well powered for identifying genes with expression changes while the false discovery rate is well controlled. SCPattern is also able to accurately classify these dynamic genes into directional expression patterns. Applied to a scRNA-seq time course dataset studying human embryonic cell differentiation, SCPattern detected a group of important genes that are involved in mesendoderm and definitive endoderm cell fate decisions, positional patterning, and cell cycle.The SCPattern is implemented as an R package along with a user-friendly graphical interface, which are available at:https://github.com/lengning/SCPatternContact:rstewart@morgridge.org	2007	5.494866529774128	6	21	1	4.982561036372695e-4	10.55
10.1101/047365	FALSE	TRUE	Order under uncertainty: robust differential expression analysis using probabilistic models for pseudotime inference	2016-04-05	Single cell gene expression profiling can be used to quantify transcriptional dynamics in temporal processes, such as cell differentiation, using computational methods to label each cell with a ‘pseudotime’ where true time series experimentation is too difficult to perform. However, owing to the high variability in gene expression between individual cells, there is an inherent uncertainty in the precise temporal ordering of the cells. Preexisting methods for pseudotime ordering have predominantly given point estimates precluding a rigorous analysis of the implications of uncertainty. We use probabilistic modelling techniques to quantify pseudotime uncertainty and propagate this into downstream differential expression analysis. We demonstrate that reliance on a point estimate of pseudotime can lead to inflated false discovery rates compared and that probabilistic approaches provide greater robustness and measures of the temporal resolution that can be obtained from pseudotime inference.	2000	5.475701574264202	2	30	0	0	5.6
10.1101/047845	FALSE	TRUE	SLICER: Inferring Branched, Nonlinear Cellular Trajectories from Single Cell RNA-seq Data	2016-04-09	Single cell experiments provide an unprecedented opportunity to reconstruct a sequence of changes in a biological process from individual “snapshots” of cells. However, nonlinear gene expression changes, genes unrelated to the process, and the possibility of branching trajectories make this a challenging problem. We developed SLICER (Selective Locally Linear Inference of Cellular Expression Relationships) to address these challenges. SLICER can infer highly nonlinear trajectories, select genes without prior knowledge of the process, and automatically determine the location and number of branches and loops. SLICER more accurately recovers the ordering of points along simulated trajectories than existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SLICER on previously published data from mouse lung cells and neural stem cells.	1996	5.464750171115674	3	26	0	0	11.68
10.1101/051631	FALSE	TRUE	Visualizing the Structure of RNA-seq Expression Data using Grade of Membership Models	2016-05-04	Grade of membership models, also known as “admixture models”, “topic models” or “Latent Dirichlet Allocation”, are a generalization of cluster models that allow each sample to have membership in multiple clusters. These models are widely used in population genetics to model admixed individuals who have ancestry from multiple “populations”, and in natural language processing to model documents having words from multiple “topics”. Here we illustrate the potential for these models to cluster samples of RNA-seq gene expression data, measured on either bulk samples or single cells. We also provide methods to help interpret the clusters, by identifying genes that are distinctively expressed in each cluster. By applying these methods to several example RNA-seq applications we demonstrate their utility in identifying and summarizing structure and heterogeneity. Applied to data from the GTEx project on 53 human tissues, the approach highlights similarities among biologically-related tissues and identifies distinctively-expressed genes that recapitulate known biology. Applied to single-cell expression data from mouse preimplantation embryos, the approach highlights both discrete and continuous variation through early embryonic development stages, and highlights genes involved in a variety of relevant processes – from germ cell development, through compaction and morula formation, to the formation of inner cell mass and trophoblast at the blastocyst stage. The methods are implemented in the Bioconductor package CountClust.Gene expression profile of a biological sample (either from single cells or pooled cells) results from a complex interplay of multiple related biological processes. Consequently, for example, distal tissue samples may share a similar gene expression profile through some common underlying biological processes. Our goal here is to illustrate that grade of membership (GoM) models – an approach widely used in population genetics to cluster admixed individuals who have ancestry from multiple populations – provide an attractive approach for clustering biological samples of RNA sequencing data. The GoM model allows each biological sample to have partial memberships in multiple biologically-distinct clusters, in contrast to traditional clustering methods that partition samples into distinct subgroups. We also provide methods for identifying genes that are distinctively expressed in each cluster to help biologically interpret the results. Applied to a dataset of 53 human tissues, the GoM approach highlights similarities among biologically-related tissues and identifies distinctively-expressed genes that recapitulate known biology. Applied to gene expression data of single cells from mouse preimplantation embryos, the approach highlights both discrete and continuous variation through early embryonic development stages, and genes involved in a variety of relevant processes. Our study highlights the potential of GoM models for elucidating biological structure in RNA-seq gene expression data.	1971	5.3963039014373715	3	67	1	5.073566717402334e-4	53.546
10.1101/051755	FALSE	TRUE	UMI-tools: Modelling sequencing errors in Unique Molecular Identifiers to improve quantification accuracy	2016-05-09	Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) are random oligonucleotide barcodes that are increasingly used in high-throughout sequencing experiments. Through a UMI, identical copies arising from distinct molecules can be distinguished from those arising through PCR amplification of the same molecule. However, bioinformatic methods to leverage the information from UMIs have yet to be formalised. In particular, sequencing errors in the UMI sequence are often ignored, or else resolved in an ad-hoc manner. We show that errors in the UMI sequence are common and introduce network-based methods to account for these errors when identifying PCR duplicates. Using these methods, we demonstrate improved quantification accuracy both under simulated conditions and real iCLIP and single cell RNA-Seq datasets. Reproducibility between iCLIP replicates and single cell RNA-Seq clustering are both improved using our proposed network-based method, demonstrating the value of properly accounting for errors in UMIs. These methods are implemented in the open source UMI-tools software package (https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools).	1966	5.382614647501711	3	23	17	0.008646998982706003	13.8
10.1101/052225	FALSE	TRUE	Visualization and analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data by kernel-based similarity learning	2016-05-09	Single-cell RNA-seq technologies enable high throughput gene expression measurement of individual cells, and allow the discovery of heterogeneity within cell populations. Measurement of cell-to-cell gene expression similarity is critical to identification, visualization and analysis of cell populations. However, single-cell data introduce challenges to conventional measures of gene expression similarity because of the high level of noise, outliers and dropouts. Here, we propose a novel similarity-learning framework, SIMLR (single-cell interpretation via multi-kernel learning), which learns an appropriate distance metric from the data for dimension reduction, clustering and visualization applications. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods for these applications, we used SIMLR to re-analyse seven representative single-cell data sets, including high-throughput droplet-based data sets with tens of thousands of cells. We show that SIMLR greatly improves clustering sensitivity and accuracy, as well as the visualization and interpretability of the data.	1966	5.382614647501711	5	49	8	0.004069175991861648	43.806

Here we present PIVOT, an R-based application with a uniform user interface and graphical data management that allows non-programmers to conveniently access various bioinformatics tools and interactively explore transcriptomics data. PIVOT supports many popular open source packages for transcriptome analysis and provides an extensive set of tools for statistical data manipulations. A graph-based visual interface is used to represent the links between derived datasets, allowing easy tracking of data versions. PIVOT further supports automatic report generation, publication-quality plots, and program/data state saving, such that all analysis can be saved, shared and reproduced.	1962	5.371663244353183	6	45	1	5.096839959225281e-4	11.83

Through exploiting high resolution single cell transcription experiments we show that cells can be located on a landscape that reflects their differentiated nature.Our approach makes use of probabilistic non-linear dimensionality reduction that respects the topology of our estimated epigenetic landscape. In simulation studies and analyses of real data we show that the approach, known as topslam, outperforms previous attempts to understand the differentiation landscape.Hereby, the novelty of our approach lies in the correction of distances before extracting ordering information. This gives the advantage over other attempts, which have to correct for extracted time lines by post processing or additional data.	1936	5.300479123887748	2	36	7	0.003615702479338843	19.95
10.1101/060442	FALSE	TRUE	A descriptive marker gene approach to single-cell pseudotime inference	2016-06-23	Pseudotime estimation from single-cell gene expression allows the recovery of temporal information from otherwise static profiles of individual cells. This pseudotemporal information can be used to characterise transient events in temporally evolving biological systems. Conventional algorithms typically emphasise an unsupervised transcriptome-wide approach and use retrospective analysis to evaluate the behaviour of individual genes. Here we introduce an orthogonal approach termed “Ouija” that learns pseudotimes from a small set of marker genes that might ordinarily be used to retrospectively confirm the accuracy of unsupervised pseudotime algorithms. Crucially, we model these genes in terms of switch-like or transient behaviour along the trajectory, allowing us to understand why the pseudotimes have been inferred and learn informative parameters about the behaviour of each gene. Since each gene is associated with a switch or peak time the genes are effectively ordered along with the cells, allowing each part of the trajectory to be understood in terms of the behaviour of certain genes. In the following we introduce our model and demonstrate that in many instances a small panel of marker genes can recover pseudotimes that are consistent with those obtained using the entire transcriptome. Furthermore, we show that our method can detect differences in the regulation timings between two genes and identify “metastable” states - discrete cell types along the continuous trajectories - that recapitulate known cell types. Ouija therefore provides a powerful complimentary approach to existing whole transcriptome based pseudotime estimation methods. An open source implementation is available at http://www.github.com/kieranrcampbell/ouija as an R package and at http://www.github.com/kieranrcampbell/ouijaflow as a Python/TensorFlow package.	1921	5.259411362080766	2	47	6	0.0031233732431025507	29.73
10.1101/064006	FALSE	TRUE	Falco: A quick and flexible single-cell RNA-seq processing framework on the cloud	2016-07-15	Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is increasingly used in a range of biomedical studies. Nonetheless, current RNA-seq analysis tools are not specifically designed to efficiently process scRNA-seq data due to their limited scalability. Here we introduce Falco, a cloud-based framework to enable paralellisation of existing RNA-seq processing pipelines using big data technologies of Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark for performing massively parallel analysis of large scale transcriptomic data. Using two public scRNA-seq data sets and two popular RNA-seq alignment/feature quantification pipelines, we show that the same processing pipeline runs 2.6 – 145.4 times faster using Falco than running on a highly optimised single node analysis. Falco also allows user to the utilise low-cost spot instances of Amazon Web Services (AWS), providing a 65% reduction in cost of analysis.Falco is available via a GNU General Public License at https://github.com/VCCRI/Falco/j.ho@victorchang.edu.auSupplementary data are available at BioRXiv online.	1899	5.19917864476386	4	17	2	0.00105318588730911	15.746
10.1101/065094	FALSE	TRUE	Dropout-based feature selection for scRNASeq	2016-07-21	Features selection is a key step in many single-cell RNASeq (scRNASeq) analyses. Feature selection is intended to preserve biologically relevant information while removing genes only subject to technical noise. As it is frequently performed prior to dimensionality reduction, clustering and pseudotime analyses, feature selection can have a major impact on the results. Several different approaches have been proposed for unsupervised feature selection from unprocessed single-cell expression matrices, most based upon identifying highly variable genes in the dataset. We present two methods which take advantage of the prevalence of zeros (dropouts) in scRNASeq data to identify features. We show that dropout-based feature selection outperforms variance-based feature selection for multiple applications of single-cell RNASeq.	1893	5.1827515400410675	2	38	14	0.007395668251452721	18.35
10.1101/065912	FALSE	TRUE	Massively parallel digital transcriptional profiling of single cells	2016-07-26	Characterizing the transcriptome of individual cells is fundamental to understanding complex biological systems. We describe a droplet-based system that enables 3′ mRNA counting of up to tens of thousands of single cells per sample. Cell encapsulation in droplets takes place in ∼6 minutes, with ∼50% cell capture efficiency, up to 8 samples at a time. The speed and efficiency allow the processing of precious samples while minimizing stress to cells. To demonstrate the system′s technical performance and its applications, we collected transcriptome data from ∼¼ million single cells across 29 samples. First, we validate the sensitivity of the system and its ability to detect rare populations using cell lines and synthetic RNAs. Then, we profile 68k peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to demonstrate the system′s ability to characterize large immune populations. Finally, we use sequence variation in the transcriptome data to determine host and donor chimerism at single cell resolution in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) of transplant patients. This analysis enables characterization of the complex interplay between donor and host cells and monitoring of treatment response. This high-throughput system is robust and enables characterization of diverse biological systems with single cell mRNA analysis.	1888	5.169062286105407	32	41	11	0.005826271186440678	77.964
10.1101/068775	FALSE	TRUE	CIDR: Ultrafast and accurate clustering through imputation for single-cell RNA-Seq data	2016-08-10	Most existing dimensionality reduction and clustering packages for single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data deal with dropouts by heavy modelling and computational machinery. Here we introduce CIDR (Clustering through Imputation and Dimensionality Reduction), an ultrafast algorithm which uses a novel yet very simple ‘implicit imputation’ approach to alleviate the impact of dropouts in scRNA-Seq data in a principled manner. Using a range of simulated and real data, we have shown that CIDR improves the standard principal component analysis and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, namely t-SNE, ZIFA and RaceID, in terms of clustering accuracy.

However, preparing raw sequence data for further analysis is not a straightforward process. Biases, artifacts, and other sources of unwanted variation are present in the data, requiring substantial time and effort to be spent on pre-processing, quality control (QC) and normalisation.We have developed the R/Bioconductor package scater to facilitate rigorous pre-processing, quality control, normalisation and visualisation of scRNA-seq data. The package provides a convenient, flexible workflow to process raw sequencing reads into a high-quality expression dataset ready for downstream analysis. scater provides a rich suite of plotting tools for single-cell data and a flexible data structure that is compatible with existing tools and can be used as infrastructure for future software development.The open-source code, along with installation instructions, vignettes and case studies, is available through Bioconductor at http://bioconductor.org/packages/scater.Supplementary material is available online at bioRxiv accompanying this manuscript, and all materials required to reproduce the results presented in this paper are available at dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.60139.	1868	5.114305270362765	4	57	12	0.006423982869379015	32.446
10.1101/070151	FALSE	TRUE	Tracing co-regulatory network dynamics in noisy, single-cell transcriptome trajectories	2016-08-18	The availability of gene expression data at the single cell level makes it possible to probe the molecular underpinnings of complex biological processes such as differentiation and oncogenesis. Promising new methods have emerged for reconstructing a progression ‘trajectory’ from static single-cell transcriptome measurements. However, it remains unclear how to adequately model the appreciable level of noise in these data to elucidate gene regulatory network rewiring. Here, we present a framework called Single Cell Inference of MorphIng Trajectories and their Associated Regulation (SCIMITAR) that infers progressions from static single-cell transcriptomes by employing a continuous parametrization of Gaussian mixtures in high-dimensional curves. SCIMITAR yields rich models from the data that highlight genes with expression and co-expression patterns that are associated with the inferred progression. Further, SCIMITAR extracts regulatory states from the implicated trajectory-evolving co-expression networks. We benchmark the method on simulated data to show that it yields accurate cell ordering and gene network inferences. Applied to the interpretation of a single-cell human fetal neuron dataset, SCIMITAR finds progression-associated genes in cornerstone neural differentiation pathways missed by standard differential expression tests. Finally, by leveraging the rewiring of gene-gene co-expression relations across the progression, the method reveals the rise and fall of co-regulatory states and trajectory-dependent gene modules. These analyses implicate new transcription factors in neural differentiation including putative co-factors for the multi-functional NFAT pathway.	1865	5.106091718001369	2	26	1	5.361930294906167e-4	7.2
10.1101/072744	FALSE	TRUE	Targeted reconstruction of T cell receptor sequence from single cell RNA-sequencing links CDR3 length to T cell differentiation state	2016-08-31	"The T cell compartment must contain diversity in both TCR repertoire and cell state to provide effective immunity against pathogens1,2. However, it remains unclear how differences in the TCR contribute to heterogeneity in T cell state at the single cell level because most analysis of the TCR repertoire has, to date, aggregated information from populations of cells. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can allow simultaneous measurement of TCR sequence and global transcriptional profile from single cells. However, current protocols to directly sequence the TCR require the use of long sequencing reads, increasing the cost and decreasing the number of cells that can be feasibly analyzed. Here we present a tool that can efficiently extract TCR sequence information from standard, short-read scRNA-seq libraries of T cells: TCR Reconstruction Algorithm for Paired-End Single cell (TRAPeS). We apply it to investigate heterogeneity in the CD8+T cell response in humans and mice, and show that it is accurate and more sensitive than previous approaches3,4. We applied TRAPeS to single cell RNA-seq of CD8+T cells specific for a single epitope from Yellow Fever Virus5. We show that the recently-described ""naive-like"" memory population of YFV-specific CD8+T cells have significantly longer CDR3 regions and greater divergence from germline sequence than do effector-memory phenotype CD8+T cells specific for YFV. This suggests that TCR usage contributes to heterogeneity in the differentiation state of the CD8+T cell response to YFV. TRAPeS is publicly available, and can be readily used to investigate the relationship between the TCR repertoire and cellular phenotype."	1852	5.070499657768652	13	49	4	0.0021598272138228943	4.85
10.1101/073692	FALSE	TRUE	Power Analysis of Single Cell RNA-Sequencing Experiments	2016-09-08	High-throughput single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become an established and powerful method to investigate transcriptomic cell-to-cell variation, and has revealed new cell types, and new insights into developmental process and stochasticity in gene expression. There are now several published scRNA-seq protocols, which all sequence transcriptomes from a minute amount of starting material. Therefore, a key question is how these methods compare in terms of sensitivity of detection of mRNA molecules, and accuracy of quantification of gene expression. Here, we assessed the sensitivity and accuracy of many published data sets based on standardized spike-ins with a uniform raw data processing pipeline. We developed a flexible and fast UMI counting tool (https://github.com/vals/umis) which is compatible with all UMI based protocols. This allowed us to relate these parameters to sequencing depth, and discuss the trade offs between the different methods. To confirm our results, we performed experiments on cells from the same population using three different protocols. We also investigated the effect of RNA degradation on spike-in molecules, and the average efficiency of scRNA-seq on spike-in molecules versus endogenous RNAs.	1844	5.048596851471594	8	21	7	0.003796095444685466	69.176
10.1101/074971	FALSE	TRUE	Temporal mixture modelling of single-cell RNA-seq data resolves a CD4+ T cell fate bifurcation	2016-09-13	Differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into functionally distinct T helper subsets is crucial for the orchestration of immune responses. Due to multiple levels of heterogeneity and multiple overlapping transcriptional programs in differentiating T cell populations, this process has remained a challenge for systematic dissection in vivo. By using single-cell RNA transcriptomics and computational modelling of temporal mixtures, we reconstructed the developmental trajectories of Th1 and Tfh cell populations during Plasmodium infection in mice at single-cell resolution. These cell fates emerged from a common, highly proliferative and metabolically active precursor. Moreover, by tracking clonality from T cell receptor sequences, we infer that ancestors derived from the same naïve CD4+ T cell can concurrently populate both Th1 and Tfh subsets. We further found that precursor T cells were coached towards a Th1 but not a Tfh fate by monocytes/macrophages. The integrated genomic and computational approach we describe is applicable for analysis of any cellular system characterized by differentiation towards multiple fates.Using single-cell RNA sequencing and a novel unsupervised computational approach, we resolve the developmental trajectories of two CD4+ T cell fates in vivo, and show that uncommitted T cells are externally influenced towards one fate by inflammatory monocytes.	1839	5.034907597535934	18	73	4	0.002175095160413268	20.55

A new application of single-cell whole-transcriptomics is the unbiased ordering of cells according to their progression along a dynamic process of interest. We introduce SCORPIUS, a method which can effectively reconstruct an ordering of individual cells without any prior information about the dynamic process. Comprehensive evaluation using ten scRNA-seq datasets shows that SCORPIUS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques. We used SCORPIUS to generate novel hypotheses regarding dendritic cell development, which were subsequently validated in vivo. This work enables data-driven investigation and characterization of dynamic processes and lays the foundation for objective benchmarking of future trajectory inference methods.	1816	4.971937029431896	9	44	37	0.020374449339207047	11.434

Methods for automatically characterizing the functional identity of cells, and their associated properties, can be used to uncover processes involved in lineage differentiation as well as sub-typing cancer cells. They can also be used to suggest personalized therapies based on molecular signatures associated with pathology. We develop a new method, called ACTION, to infer the functional identity of cells from their transcriptional profile, classify them based on their dominant function, and reconstruct regulatory networks that are responsible for mediating their identity. Using ACTION, we identify novel Melanoma sub-types with differential survival rates and therapeutic responses, for which we provide biomarkers along with their underlying regulatory networks.	1807	4.947296372347707	4	41	0	0	11.934

Here, we use multivariate information theory to explore the statistical dependencies between triplets of genes in single-cell gene expression datasets. We develop PIDC, a fast, efficient algorithm that uses partial information decomposition (PID) to identify regulatory relationships between genes. We thoroughly evaluate the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate that the higher order information captured by PIDC allows it to outperform pairwise mutual information-based algorithms when recovering true relationships present in simulated data. We also infer gene regulatory networks from three experimental single-cell data sets and illustrate how network context, choices made during analysis, and sources of variability affect network inference. PIDC tutorials and open-source software for estimating PID are available here:https://github.com/Tchanders/network_inference_tutorials.

10.1101/084202	FALSE	TRUE	Single-cell entropy for accurate estimation of differentiation potency from a cell’s transcriptome	2016-10-30	The ability to quantify differentiation potential of single cells is a task of critical importance for single-cell studies. So far however, there is no robust general molecular correlate of differentiation potential at the single cell level. Here we show that differentiation potency of a single cell can be approximated by computing the signaling promiscuity, or entropy, of a cell’s transcriptomic profile in the context of a cellular interaction network, without the need for model training or feature selection. We validate signaling entropy in over 7,000 single cell RNA-Seq profiles, representing all main differentiation stages, including time-course data. We develop a novel algorithm called Single Cell Entropy (SCENT), which correctly identifies known cell subpopulations of varying potency, enabling reconstruction of cell-lineage trajectories. By comparing bulk to single cell data, SCENT reveals that expression heterogeneity within single cell populations is regulated, pointing towards the importance of cell-cell interactions. In the context of cancer, SCENT can identify drug resistant cancer stem-cell phenotypes, including those obtained from circulating tumor cells. In summary, SCENT can directly estimate the differentiation potency and plasticity of single-cells, allowing unbiased quantification of intercellular heterogeneity, and providing a means to identify normal and cancer stem cell phenotypes.SCENT is freely available as an R-package from github: https://github.com/aet21/SCENT	1792	4.906228610540725	1	38	2	0.0011160714285714285	6.5

Such heterogeneity can arise from both technical and biological factors, thus making decomposing sources of variation extremely difficult. We here describe a computationally efficient model that uses prior pathway annotation to guide inference of the biological drivers underpinning the heterogeneity. Moreover, we jointly update and improve gene set annotation and infer factors explaining variability that fall outside the existing annotation. We validate our method using simulations, which demonstrate both its accuracy and its ability to scale to large datasets with up to 100,000 cells. Moreover, through applications to real data we show that our model can robustly decompose scRNA-seq datasets into interpretable components and facilitate the identification of novel sub-populations.	1776	4.862422997946612	4	31	6	0.0033783783783783786	37.446
10.1101/088856	FALSE	TRUE	SCODE: An efficient regulatory network inference algorithm from single-cell RNA-Seq during differentiation	2016-11-21	The analysis of RNA-Seq data from individual differentiating cells enables us to reconstruct the differentiation process and the degree of differentiation (in pseudo-time) of each cell. Such analyses can reveal detailed expression dynamics and functional relationships for differentiation. To further elucidate differentiation processes, more insight into gene regulatory networks is required. The pseudo-time can be regarded as time information and, therefore, single-cell RNA-Seq data are time-course data with high time resolution. Although time-course data are useful for inferring networks, conventional inference algorithms for such data suffer from high time complexity when the number of samples and genes is large. Therefore, a novel algorithm is necessary to infer networks from single-cell RNA-Seq during differentiation.In this study, we developed the novel and efficient algorithm SCODE to infer regulatory networks, based on ordinary differential equations. We applied SCODE to three single-cell RNA-Seq datasets and confirmed that SCODE can reconstruct observed expression dynamics. We evaluated SCODE by comparing its inferred networks with use of a DNaseI-footprint based network. The performance of SCODE was best for two of the datasets and nearly best for the remaining dataset. We also compared the runtimes and showed that the runtimes for SCODE are significantly shorter than for alternatives. Thus, our algorithm provides a promising approach for further single-cell differentiation analyses.The R source code of SCODE is available at https://github.com/hmatsu1226/SCODE.	1770	4.84599589322382	8	38	2	0.0011299435028248588	35.61
10.1101/089110	FALSE	TRUE	SINCERITIES: Inferring gene regulatory networks from time-stamped single cell transcriptional expression profiles	2016-11-23	Recent advances in single cell transcriptional profiling open up a new avenue in studying the functional role of cell-to-cell variability in physiological processes such as stem cell differentiation. In this work, we developed a novel algorithm called SINCERITIES (SINgle CEll Regularized Inference using TIme-stamped Expression profileS), for the inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from single cell transcriptional expression data. In particular, we focused on time-stamped cross-sectional expression data, a common type of dataset generated from transcriptional profiling of single cells collected at multiple time points after cell stimulation. SINCERITIES recovers the regulatory (causal) relationships among genes by employing regularized linear regression, particularly ridge regression, using temporal changes in the distributions of gene expressions. Meanwhile, the modes of the gene regulations (activation and repression) come from partial correlation analyses between pairs of genes. We demonstrated the efficacy of SINCERITIES in inferring GRNs using simulated time-stamped in silico single cell expression data and single transcriptional profiling of THP-1 monocytic human leukemia cell differentiation. The case studies showed that SINCERITIES could provide accurate GRN predictions, significantly better than other GRN inference algorithms such as TSNI, GENIE3 and JUMP3. Meanwhile, SINCERITIES has a low computational complexity and is amenable to problems of extremely large dimensionality.	1768	4.8405201916495555	3	58	3	0.0016968325791855204	9.934

Consequently, applying existing normalization methods to single-cell RNA-seq data introduces artifacts that bias downstream analyses. To address this, we introduce SCnorm for accurate and efficient normalization of scRNA-seq data.	1763	4.826830937713894	8	17	2	0.0011344299489506524	23.296
10.1101/090332	FALSE	TRUE	SPRING: a kinetic interface for visualizing high dimensional single-cell expression data	2016-11-29	Single-cell gene expression profiling technologies can map the cell states in a tissue or organism. As these technologies become more common, there is a need for computational tools to explore the data they produce. In particular, existing data visualization approaches are imperfect for studying continuous gene expression topologies.Force-directed layouts of k-nearest-neighbor graphs can visualize continuous gene expression topologies in a manner that preserves high-dimensional relationships and allows manually exploration of different stable two-dimensional representations of the same data. We implemented an interactive web-tool to visualize single-cell data using force-directed graph layouts, called SPRING. SPRING reveals more detailed biological relationships than existing approaches when applied to branching gene expression trajectories from hematopoietic progenitor cells. Visualizations from SPRING are also more reproducible than those of stochastic visualization methods such as tSNE, a state-of-the-art tool.https://kleintools.hms.harvard.edu/tools/spring.html,https://github.com/AllonKleinLab/SPRING/calebsw@gmail.com, allon_klein@hms.harvard.edu	1762	4.824093086926762	3	10	10	0.0056753688989784334	23.75
10.1101/094532	FALSE	TRUE	Model-based branching point detection in single-cell data by K-Branches clustering	2016-12-15	The identification of heterogeneities in cell populations by utilizing single-cell technologies such as single-cell RNA-Seq, enables inference of cellular development and lineage trees. Several methods have been proposed for such inference from high-dimensional single-cell data. They typically assign each cell to a branch in a differentiation trajectory. However, they commonly assume specific geometries such as tree-like developmental hierarchies and lack statistically sound methods to decide on the number of branching events.We present K-Branches, a solution to the above problem by locally fitting half-lines to single-cell data, introducing a clustering algorithm similar to K-Means. These halflines are proxies for branches in the differentiation trajectory of cells. We propose a modified version of the GAP statistic for model selection, in order to decide on the number of lines that best describe the data locally. In this manner, we identify the location and number of subgroups of cells that are associated with branching events and full differentiation, respectively. We evaluate the performance of our method on single-cell RNA-Seq data describing the differentiation of myeloid progenitors during hematopoiesis, single-cell qPCR data of mouse blastocyst development and artificial data.An R implementation of K-Branches is freely available at https://github.com/theislab/kbranchesfabian.theis@helmholtz-muenchen.de	1746	4.780287474332649	3	21	0	0	3.5

We propose to use effective and expressed nucleotide variations (eeSNVs) from scRNA-seq as alternative features for tumor subpopulation identification. We developed a linear modeling framework, SSrGE, to link eeSNVs associated with gene expression. In all the datasets tested, eeSNVs achieve better accuracies than gene expression for identifying subpopulations. Previously validated cancer-relevant genes are also highly ranked, confirming the significance of the method. Moreover, SSrGE is capable of analyzing coupled DNA-seq and RNA-seq data from the same single cells, demonstrating its value in integrating multi-omics single cell techniques. In summary, SNV features from scRNA-seq data have merits for both subpopulation identification and linkage of genotype-phenotype relationship. The method SSrGE is available at https://github.com/lanagarmire/SSrGE.	1740	4.763860369609857	4	76	4	0.0022988505747126436	20.046

Such analytical capacity is of great interest to many research groups in the world, yet, these groups often lack the expertise to handle complex scRNA-seq data sets.We developed a fully integrated, web-based platform aimed at the complete analysis of scRNA-seq data post genome alignment: from the parsing, filtering, and normalization of the input count data files, to the visual representation of the data, identification of cell clusters, differentially expressed genes (including cluster-specific marker genes), and functional gene set enrichment. This Automated Single-cell Analysis Pipeline (ASAP) combines a wide range of commonly used algorithms with sophisticated visualization tools. Compared with existing scRNA-seq analysis platforms, researchers (including those lacking computational expertise) are able to interact with the data in a straightforward fashion and in real time. Furthermore, given the overlap between scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq analysis workflows, ASAP should conceptually be broadly applicable to any RNA-seq dataset. As a validation, we demonstrate how we can use ASAP to simply reproduce the results from a single-cell study of 91 mouse cells involving five distinct cell types.The tool is freely available at http://asap.epfl.chbart.deplancke@epfl.ch	1739	4.761122518822724	5	12	5	0.002875215641173088	10.75

While scRNA-seq provides a comprehensive measurement of stochasticity in transcription, the limitations of the technology have prevented its application to dissect variability in RNA processing events such as splicing. Here we present BRIE (Bayesian Regression for Isoform Estimation), a Bayesian hierarchical model which resolves these problems by learning an informative prior distribution from sequence features. We show that BRIE yields reproducible estimates of exon inclusion ratios in single cells and provides an effective tool for differential isoform quantification between scRNA-seq data sets. BRIE therefore expands the scope of scRNA-seq experiments to probe the stochasticity of RNA-processing.	1725	4.722792607802875	2	28	1	5.797101449275362e-4	14.85
10.1101/099473	FALSE	TRUE	Cell fixation and preservation for droplet-based single-cell transcriptomics	2017-01-10	Recent developments in droplet-based microfluidics allow the transcriptional profiling of thousands of individual cells, in a quantitative, highly parallel and cost-effective way. A critical, often limiting step is the preparation of cells in an unperturbed state, not compromised by stress or ageing. Another challenge are rare cells that need to be collected over several days, or samples prepared at different times or locations.Here, we used chemical fixation to overcome these problems. Methanol fixation allowed us to stabilize and preserve dissociated cells for weeks. By using mixtures of fixed human and mouse cells, we showed that individual transcriptomes could be confidently assigned to one of the two species. Single-cell gene expression from live and fixed samples correlated well with bulk mRNA-seq data. We then applied methanol fixation to transcriptionally profile primary single cells from dissociated complex tissues. Low RNA content cells from Drosophila embryos, as well as mouse hindbrain and cerebellum cells sorted by FACS, were successfully analysed after fixation, storage and single-cell droplet RNA-seq. We were able to identify diverse cell populations, including neuronal subtypes. As an additional resource, we provide ‘dropbead’, an R package for exploratory data analysis, visualization and filtering of Drop-seq data.We expect that the availability of a simple cell fixation method will open up many new opportunities in diverse biological contexts to analyse transcriptional dynamics at single cell resolution.	1720	4.7091033538672145	13	26	6	0.0034883720930232558	21.534

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows the comparison of expression distribution between the two alleles of a diploid organism and thus the characterization of allele-specific bursting. We propose SCALE to analyze genome-wide allele-specific bursting, with adjustment of technical variability. SCALE detects genes exhibiting allelic differences in bursting parameters, and genes whose alleles burst non-independently. We apply SCALE to mouse blastocyst and human fibroblast cells and find that, globally, cis control in gene expression overwhelmingly manifests as differences in burst frequency.	1682	4.605065023956194	3	48	0	0	20.046

However, learning the structure of complex single-cell trajectories with two or more branches remains a challenging computational problem. We present Monocle 2, which uses reversed graph embedding to reconstruct single-cell trajectories in a fully unsupervised manner. Monocle 2 learns an explicit principal graph to describe the data, greatly improving the robustness and accuracy of its trajectories compared to other algorithms. Monocle 2 uncovered a new, alternative cell fate in what we previously reported to be a linear trajectory for differentiating myoblasts. We also reconstruct branched trajectories for two studies of blood development, and show that loss of function mutations in key lineage transcription factors diverts cells to alternative branches on the a trajectory. Monocle 2 is thus a powerful tool for analyzing cell fate decisions with single-cell genomics.	1678	4.594113620807666	7	53	42	0.025029797377830752	53.434

10.1101/111591	FALSE	TRUE	MAGIC: A diffusion-based imputation method reveals gene-gene interactions in single-cell RNA-sequencing data	2017-02-25	Single-cell RNA-sequencing is fast becoming a major technology that is revolutionizing biological discovery in fields such as development, immunology and cancer. The ability to simultaneously measure thousands of genes at single cell resolution allows, among other prospects, for the possibility of learning gene regulatory networks at large scales. However, scRNA-seq technologies suffer from many sources of significant technical noise, the most prominent of which is ‘dropout’ due to inefficient mRNA capture. This results in data that has a high degree of sparsity, with typically only ~10% non-zero values. To address this, we developed MAGIC (Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells), a method for imputing missing values, and restoring the structure of the data. After MAGIC, we find that two- and three-dimensional gene interactions are restored and that MAGIC is able to impute complex and non-linear shapes of interactions. MAGIC also retains cluster structure, enhances cluster-specific gene interactions and restores trajectories, as demonstrated in mouse retinal bipolar cells, hematopoiesis, and our newly generated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition dataset.	1674	4.583162217659138	10	49	48	0.02867383512544803	67.214
10.1101/116939	FALSE	TRUE	Accounting for technical noise in single-cell RNA sequencing analysis	2017-03-15	Recent technological breakthroughs have made it possible to measure RNA expression at the single-cell level, thus paving the way for exploring expression heterogeneity among individual cells. Current single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) protocols are complex and introduce technical biases that vary across cells, which can bias downstream analysis without proper adjustment. To account for cell-to-cell technical differences, we propose a statistical framework, TASC (Toolkit for Analysis of Single Cell RNA-seq), an empirical Bayes approach to reliably model the cell-specific dropout rates and amplification bias by use of external RNA spike-ins. TASC incorporates the technical parameters, which reflect cell-to-cell batch effects, into a hierarchical mixture model to estimate the biological variance of a gene and detect differentially expressed genes. More importantly, TASC is able to adjust for covariates to further eliminate confounding that may originate from cell size and cell cycle differences. In simulation and real scRNA-seq data, TASC achieves accurate Type I error control and displays competitive sensitivity and improved robustness to batch effects in differential expression analysis, compared to existing methods. TASC is programmed to be computationally efficient, taking advantage of multi-threaded parallelization. We believe that TASC will provide a robust platform for researchers to leverage the power of scRNA-seq.	1656	4.5338809034907595	5	26	2	0.0012077294685990338	10.5

By the onset of morphogenesis, ~6000 cells express distinct gene combinations according to embryonic position. Despite extensive mRNA in situ screens, combinatorial gene expression within individual cells is largely unknown. Therefore, it is difficult to comprehensively identify the coding and non-coding transcripts that drive patterning and to decipher the molecular basis of cellular identity. Here, we single-cell sequence precisely staged embryos, measuring &gt;3100 genes per cell. We produce a ‘transcriptomic blueprint’ of development – a virtual embryo where 3D locations of sequenced cells are confidently identified. Our “Drosophila-Virtual-Expression-eXplorer” performs virtual in situ hybridizations and computes expression gradients. Using DVEX, we predict spatial expression and discover patterned lncRNAs. DEVX is sensitive enough to detect subtle evolutionary changes in expression patterns between Drosophila species. We believe DVEX is a prototype for powerful single cell studies in complex tissues.	1654	4.528405201916495	9	50	3	0.0018137847642079807	115.834

Multiplexing samples for single cell capture and library preparation in dscRNA-seq would enable cost-effective designs of differential expression and genetic studies while avoiding technical batch effects, but its implementation remains challenging. Here, we introduce an in-silico algorithm demuxlet that harnesses natural genetic variation to discover the sample identity of each cell and identify droplets containing two cells. These capabilities enable multiplexed dscRNA-seq experiments where cells from unrelated individuals are pooled and captured at higher throughput than standard workflows. To demonstrate the performance of demuxlet, we sequenced 3 pools of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 8 lupus patients. Given genotyping data for each individual, demuxlet correctly recovered the sample identity of &gt; 99% of singlets, and identified doublets at rates consistent with previous estimates. In PBMCs, we demonstrate the utility of multiplexed dscRNA-seq in two applications: characterizing cell type specificity and inter-individual variability of cytokine response from 8 lupus patients and mapping genetic variants associated with cell type specific gene expression from 23 donors. Demuxlet is fast, accurate, scalable and could be extended to other single cell datasets that incorporate natural or synthetic DNA barcodes.	1651	4.520191649555099	15	48	5	0.0030284675953967293	37.134

Because of the low amount of RNA present in a single cell, some genes may fail to be detected even though they are expressed; these genes are usually referred to as dropouts. Here, we present a general and flexible zero-inflated negative binomial model (ZINB-WaVE), which leads to low-dimensional representations of the data that account for zero inflation (dropouts), over-dispersion, and the count nature of the data. We demonstrate, with simulated and real data, that the model and its associated estimation procedure are able to give a more stable and accurate low-dimensional representation of the data than principal component analysis (PCA) and zero-inflated factor analysis (ZIFA), without the need for a preliminary normalization step.	1634	4.473648186173854	5	60	22	0.01346389228886169	20.55

10.1101/130336	FALSE	TRUE	Manifold alignment reveals correspondence between single cell transcriptome and epigenome dynamics	2017-04-24	Single cell genomic techniques promise to yield key insights into the dynamic interplay between gene expression and epigenetic modification. However, the experimental difficulty of performing multiple measurements on the same cell currently limits efforts to combine multiple genomic data sets into a united picture of single cell variation. We show that it is possible to construct cell trajectories, reflecting the changes that occur in a sequential biological process, from single cell ATAC-seq, bisulfite sequencing, and ChIP-seq data. In addition, we present an approach called MATCHER that computationally circumvents the experimental difficulties inherent in performing multiple genomic measurements on a single cell by inferring correspondence between single cell transcriptomic and epigenetic measurements performed on different cells of the same type. MATCHER works by first learning a separate manifold for the trajectory of each kind of genomic data, then aligning the manifolds to infer a shared trajectory in which cells measured using different techniques are directly comparable. Using scM&amp;T-seq data, we confirm that MATCHER accurately predicts true single cell correlations between DNA methylation and gene expression without using known cell correspondence information. We also used MATCHER to infer correlations among gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and histone modifications in single mouse embryonic stem cells. These results reveal the dynamic interplay between epigenetic changes and gene expression underlying the transition from pluripotency to differentiation priming. Our work is a first step toward a united picture of heterogeneous transcriptomic and epigenetic states in single cells.	1616	4.424366872005476	3	51	0	0	8.25

However, it has not been straightforward to infer differentiation trajectories from such data, due to the parameter-sensitivity of existing methods. Here, we present Finding Orderings Robustly using k-means and Steiner trees (FORKS), an algorithm that pseudo-temporally orders cells and thereby infers bifurcating state trajectories. FORKS, which is a generic method, can be applied to both single-cell and bulk differentiation data. It is a semi-supervised approach, in that it requires the user to specify the starting point of the time course. We systematically benchmarked FORKS and eight other pseudo-time estimation algorithms on six benchmark datasets, and found it to be more accurate, more reproducible, and more memory-efficient than existing methods for pseudo-temporal ordering. Another major advantage of our approach is its robustness – FORKS can be used with default parameter settings on a wide range of datasets.	1609	4.405201916495551	5	65	1	6.215040397762585e-4	7.5

However, this step can be difficult due to high rates of mismatch and deletion errors that can afflict barcodes. Here we present an approach to identify and error-correct barcodes by traversing the de Bruijn graph of circularized barcode k-mers. This allows for assignment of reads to consensus fingerprints constructed from k-mers, and we show that for single-cell RNA-Seq this improves the recovery of accurate single-cell transcriptome estimates.	1601	4.383299110198494	2	17	3	0.0018738288569643974	36.1
10.1101/138677	FALSE	TRUE	SAVER: Gene expression recovery for UMI-based single cell RNA sequencing	2017-05-16	Rapid advances in massively parallel single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is paving the way for high-resolution single cell profiling of biological samples. In most scRNA-seq studies, only a small fraction of the transcripts present in each cell are sequenced. The efficiency, that is, the proportion of transcripts in the cell that are sequenced, can be especially low in highly parallelized experiments where the number of reads allocated for each cell is small. This leads to unreliable quantification of lowly and moderately expressed genes, resulting in extremely sparse data and hindering downstream analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce SAVER (Single-cell Analysis Via Expression Recovery), an expression recovery method for scRNA-seq that borrows information across genes and cells to impute the zeros as well as to improve the expression estimates for all genes. We show, by comparison to RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and by data down-sampling experiments, that SAVER reliably recovers cell-specific gene expression concentrations, cross-cell gene expression distributions, and gene-to-gene and cell-to-cell correlations. This improves the power and accuracy of any downstream analysis involving genes with low to moderate expression.	1594	4.3641341546885695	10	37	16	0.010037641154328732	34.68
10.1101/141598	FALSE	TRUE	scImpute: Accurate And Robust Imputation For Single Cell RNA-Seq Data	2017-05-24	The emerging single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable the investigation of transcriptomic landscapes at single-cell resolution. The analysis of scRNA-seq data is complicated by excess zero or near zero counts, the so-called dropouts due to the low amounts of mRNA sequenced within individual cells. Downstream analysis of scRNA-seq would be severely biased if the dropout events are not properly corrected. We introduce scImpute, a statistical method to accurately and robustly impute the dropout values in scRNA-seq data. ScImpute automatically identifies gene expression values affected by dropout events, and only perform imputation on these values without introducing new bias to the rest data. ScImpute also detects outlier or rare cells and excludes them from imputation. Evaluation based on both simulated and real scRNA-seq data on mouse embryos, mouse brain cells, human blood cells, and human embryonic stem cells suggests that scImpute is an effective tool to recover transcriptome dynamics masked by dropout events. scImpute is shown to correct false zero counts, enhance the clustering of cell populations and subpopulations, improve the accuracy of differential expression analysis, and aid the study of gene expression dynamics.	1586	4.342231348391513	2	0	20	0.012610340479192938	30.834
10.1101/142398	FALSE	TRUE	Scalable preprocessing for sparse scRNA-seq data exploiting prior knowledge	2017-05-25	Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data contains a wealth of information which has to be inferred computationally from the observed sequencing reads. As the ability to sequence more cells improves rapidly, existing computational tools suffer from three problems. (1) The decreased reads-per-cell implies a highly sparse sample of the true cellular transcriptome. (2) Many tools simply cannot handle the size of the resulting datasets. (3) Prior biological knowledge such as bulk RNA-seq information of certain cell types or qualitative marker information is not taken into account. Here we present UNCURL, a preprocessing framework based on non-negative matrix factorization for scRNA-seq data, that is able to handle varying sampling distributions, scales to very large cell numbers and can incorporate prior knowledge.We find that preprocessing using UNCURL consistently improves performance of commonly used scRNA-seq tools for clustering, visualization, and lineage estimation, both in the absence and presence of prior knowledge. Finally we demonstrate that UNCURL is extremely scalable and parallelizable, and runs faster than other methods on a scRNA-seq dataset containing 1.3 million cells.Source code is available at https://github.com/yjzhang/uncurl_pythonksreeram@uw.edu, gseelig@uw.edu	1585	4.339493497604381	5	41	0	0	17.696
10.1101/143271	FALSE	TRUE	Dr.seq2: a quality control and analysis pipeline for parallel single cell transcriptome and epigenome data	2017-05-28	An increasing number of single cell transcriptome and epigenome technologies, including single cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq), have been recently developed as powerful tools to analyze the features of many individual cells simultaneously. However, the methods and software were designed for one certain data type and only for single cell transcriptome data. A systematic approach for epigenome data and multiple types of transcriptome data is needed to control data quality and to perform cell-to-cell heterogeneity analysis on these ultra-high-dimensional transcriptome and epigenome datasets. Here we developed Dr.seq2, a Quality Control (QC) and analysis pipeline for multiple types of single cell transcriptome and epigenome data, including scATAC-seq and Drop-ChIP data. Application of this pipeline provides four groups of QC measurements and different analyses, including cell heterogeneity analysis. Dr.seq2 produced reliable results on published single cell transcriptome and epigenome datasets. Overall, Dr.seq2 is a systematic and comprehensive QC and analysis pipeline designed for parallel single cell transcriptome and epigenome data.

10.1101/144501	FALSE	TRUE	SCENIC: Single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering	2017-05-31	Single-cell RNA-seq allows building cell atlases of any given tissue and infer the dynamics of cellular state transitions during developmental or disease trajectories. Both the maintenance and transitions of cell states are encoded by regulatory programs in the genome sequence. However, this regulatory code has not yet been exploited to guide the identification of cellular states from single-cell RNA-seq data. Here we describe a computational resource, called SCENIC (Single Cell rEgulatory Network Inference and Clustering), for the simultaneous reconstruction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and the identification of stable cell states, using single-cell RNA-seq data. SCENIC outperforms existing approaches at the level of cell clustering and transcription factor identification. Importantly, we show that cell state identification based on GRNs is robust towards batch-effects and technical-biases. We applied SCENIC to a compendium of single-cell data from the mouse and human brain and demonstrate that the proper combinations of transcription factors, target genes, enhancers, and cell types can be identified. Moreover, we used SCENIC to map the cell state landscape in melanoma and identified a gene regulatory network underlying a proliferative melanoma state driven by MITF and STAT and a contrasting network controlling an invasive state governed by NFATC2 and NFIB. We further validated these predictions by showing that two transcription factors are predominantly expressed in early metastatic sentinel lymph nodes. In summary, SCENIC is the first method to analyze scRNA-seq data using a network-centric, rather than cell-centric approach. SCENIC is generic, easy to use, and flexible, and allows for the simultaneous tracing of genomic regulatory programs and the mapping of cellular identities emerging from these programs. Availability: SCENIC is available as an R workflow based on three new R/Bioconductor packages: GENIE3, RcisTarget and AUCell. As scalable alternative to GENIE3, we also provide GRNboost, paving the way towards the network analysis across millions of single cells.	1579	4.323066392881588	15	106	3	0.0018999366687777073	53.214

However, due to differences in experimental methods and computational analyses, it is often challenging to directly compare the cells identified in two different experiments. Here, we present scmap (http://bioconductor.org/packages/scmap), a method for projecting cells from a scRNA-seq experiment onto the cell-types or individual cells identified in other experiments (the application can be run for free, without restrictions, from http://www.hemberg-lab.cloud/scmap).	1564	4.2819986310746065	3	38	10	0.00639386189258312	25.984
10.1101/150524	FALSE	TRUE	Addressing the looming identity crisis in single cell RNA-seq	2017-06-16	Single cell RNA-sequencing technology (scRNA-seq) provides a new avenue to discover and characterize cell types, but the experiment-specific technical biases and analytic variability inherent to current pipelines may undermine the replicability of these studies. Meta-analysis of rapidly accumulating data is further hampered by the use of ad hoc naming conventions. Here we demonstrate our replication framework, MetaNeighbor, that allows researchers to quantify the degree to which cell types replicate across datasets, and to rapidly identify clusters with high similarity for further testing. We first measure the replicability of neuronal identity by comparing more than 13 thousand individual scRNA-seq transcriptomes, sampling with high specificity from within the data to define a range of robust practices. We then assess cross-dataset evidence for novel cortical interneuron subtypes identified by scRNA-seq and find that 24/45 cortical interneuron subtypes have evidence of replication in at least one other study. Identifying these putative replicates allows us to re-analyze the data for differential expression and provide lists of robust candidate marker genes. Across tasks we find that large sets of variably expressed genes can identify replicable cell types and subtypes with high accuracy, suggesting a general route forward for large-scale evaluation of scRNA-seq data.	1563	4.2792607802874745	5	55	3	0.0019193857965451055	52.314
10.1101/151217	FALSE	TRUE	A statistical framework for the robust detection of hidden variation in single cell transcriptomes	2017-06-18	Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) precisely characterize gene expression levels and dissect variation in expression associated with the state (technical or biological) and the type of the cell, which is averaged out in bulk measurements. Multiple and correlated sources contribute to gene expression variation in single cells, which makes their estimation difficult with the existing methods developed for bulk measurements (e.g., surrogate variable analysis (SVA)) that estimate orthogonal transformations of these sources. We developed iteratively adjusted surrogate variable analysis (IA-SVA) that can estimate hidden and correlated sources of variation by identifying a set of genes affected with each hidden factor in an iterative manner. Analysis of scRNA-seq data from human cells showed that IA-SVA could accurately capture hidden variation arising from technical (e.g., stacked doublet cells) or biological sources (e.g., cell type or cell-cycle stage). Furthermore, IA-SVA delivers a set of genes associated with the detected hidden source to be used in downstream data analyses. As a proof of concept, IA-SVA recapitulated known marker genes for islet cell subsets (e.g., alpha, beta), which improved the grouping of subsets into distinct clusters. Taken together, IA-SVA is an effective and novel method to dissect multiple and correlated sources of variation in scRNA-seq data.	1561	4.27378507871321	4	31	0	0	24.864
10.1101/153940	FALSE	TRUE	zUMIs - A fast and flexible pipeline to process RNA sequencing data with UMIs	2017-06-22	Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) experiments typically analyze hundreds or thousands of cells after amplification of the cDNA. The high throughput is made possible by the early introduction of sample-specific barcodes (BCs) and the amplification bias is alleviated by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Thus the ideal analysis pipeline for scRNA-seq data needs to efficiently tabulate reads according to both BC and UMI. zUMIs is such a pipeline, it can handle both known and random BCs and also efficiently collapses UMIs, either just for Exon mapping reads or for both Exon and Intron mapping reads. Another unique feature of zUMIs is the adaptive downsampling function, that facilitates dealing with hugely varying library sizes, but also allows to evaluate whether the library has been sequenced to saturation. zUMIs flexibility allows to accommodate data generated with any of the major scRNA-seq protocols that use BCs and UMIs. To illustrate the utility of zUMIs, we analysed a single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset and show that more than 35% of all reads map to Introns. We furthermore show that these intronic reads are informative about expression levels, significantly increasing the number of detected genes and improving the cluster resolution.

It induces excess zero counts, which leads to power issues in differential expression (DE) analysis and has triggered the development of bespoke scRNA-seq DE tools that cope with zero-inflation. Recent evaluations, however, have shown that dedicated scRNA-seq tools provide no advantage compared to traditional bulk RNA-seq tools. We introduce zingeR, a zero-inflated negative binomial model that identifies excess zero counts and generates observation weights to unlock bulk RNA-seq pipelines for zero-inflation, boosting performance in scRNA-seq differential expression analysis.	1549	4.240930869267625	5	44	9	0.005810200129115558	34.95
10.1101/159913	FALSE	TRUE	Uncovering genomic trajectories with heterogeneous genetic and environmental backgrounds across single-cells and populations	2017-07-06	Pseudotime algorithms can be employed to extract latent temporal information from crosssectional data sets allowing dynamic biological processes to be studied in situations where the collection of genuine time series data is challenging or prohibitive. Computational techniques have arisen from areas such as single-cell ‘omics and in cancer modelling where pseudotime can be used to learn about cellular differentiation or tumour progression. However, methods to date typically assume homogenous genetic and environmental backgrounds, which becomes particularly limiting as datasets grow in size and complexity. As a solution to this we describe a novel statistical framework that learns pseudotime trajectories in the presence of non-homogeneous genetic, phenotypic, or environmental backgrounds. We demonstrate that this enables us to identify interactions between such factors and the underlying genomic trajectory. By applying this model to both single-cell gene expression data and population level cancer studies we show that it uncovers known and novel interaction effects between genetic and enironmental factors and the expression of genes in pathways.

10.1101/164889	FALSE	TRUE	Integrated analysis of single cell transcriptomic data across conditions, technologies, and species	2017-07-18	Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a transformative tool to discover and define cellular phenotypes. While computational scRNA-seq methods are currently well suited for experiments representing a single condition, technology, or species, analyzing multiple datasets simultaneously raises new challenges. In particular, traditional analytical workflows struggle to align subpopulations that are present across datasets, limiting the possibility for integrated or comparative analysis. Here, we introduce a new computational strategy for scRNA-seq alignment, utilizing common sources of variation to identify shared subpopulations between datasets as part of our R toolkit Seurat. We demonstrate our approach by aligning scRNA-seq datasets of PBMCs under resting and stimulated conditions, hematopoietic progenitors sequenced across two profiling technologies, and pancreatic cell ‘atlases’ generated from human and mouse islets. In each case, we learn distinct or transitional cell states jointly across datasets, and can identify subpopulations that could not be detected by analyzing datasets independently. We anticipate that these methods will serve not only to correct for batch or technology-dependent effects, but also to facilitate general comparisons of scRNA-seq datasets, potentially deepening our understanding of how distinct cell states respond to perturbation, disease, and evolution.Installation instructions, documentation, and tutorials are available at http://www.satijalab.org/seurat	1531	4.191649555099247	2	54	44	0.028739386022207707	92.17
10.1101/165118	FALSE	TRUE	Correcting batch effects in single-cell RNA sequencing data by matching mutual nearest neighbours	2017-07-18	The presence of batch effects is a well-known problem in experimental data analysis, and single- cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is no exception. Large-scale scRNA-seq projects that generate data from different laboratories and at different times are rife with batch effects that can fatally compromise integration and interpretation of the data. In such cases, computational batch correction is critical for eliminating uninteresting technical factors and obtaining valid biological conclusions. However, existing methods assume that the composition of cell populations are either known or the same across batches. Here, we present a new strategy for batch correction based on the detection of mutual nearest neighbours in the high-dimensional expression space. Our approach does not rely on pre-defined or equal population compositions across batches, only requiring that a subset of the population be shared between batches. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods on a range of simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets. We also show how our method can be applied to integrate scRNA-seq data from two separate studies of early embryonic development.	1531	4.191649555099247	4	26	16	0.010450685826257348	37.75
10.1101/166736	FALSE	TRUE	Varying-Censoring Aware Matrix Factorization for Single Cell RNA-Sequencing	2017-07-21	Single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) has become the most widely used high-throughput technology for gene expression profiling of individual cells. The potential of being able to measure cell-to-cell variability at a high-dimensional genomic scale opens numerous new lines of investigation in basic and clinical research. For example, by identifying groups of cells with expression profiles unlike those observed in cells with known phenotypes, new cell types may be discovered. Dimension reduction followed by unsupervised clustering are the quantitative approaches typically used to facilitate such discoveries. However, a challenge for this approach is that most scRNA-Seq datasets are sparse, with the percentages of measurements reported as zero ranging from 35% to 99% across cells, and these zeros are partially explained by experimental inefficiencies that lead to censored data. Furthermore, the observed across-cell differences in the percentages of zeros are partly due to technical artifacts rather than biological differences. Unfortunately, standard dimension reduction approaches treat these censored values as true zeros, which leads to the identification of distorted low-dimensional factors. When these factors are used for clustering, the distortion leads to incorrect identification of biological groups. Here, we propose an approach that accounts for cell-specific censoring with a varying-censoring aware matrix factorization (VAMF) model that permits the identification of factors in the presence of the above described systematic bias. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach on published scRNA-Seq data and confirm these on simulated data.	1528	4.183436002737851	4	29	5	0.0032722513089005235	84.4
10.1101/166868	FALSE	TRUE	BGP: Branched Gaussian processes for identifying gene-specific branching dynamics in single cell data	2017-07-21	High-throughput single-cell gene expression experiments can be used to uncover branching dynamics in cell populations undergoing differentiation through use of pseudotime methods. We develop the branching Gaussian process (BGP), a non-parametric model that is able to identify branching dynamics for individual genes and provides an estimate of branching times for each gene with an associated credible region. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic data and a published single-cell gene expression hematopoiesis study. The method requires prior information about pseudotime and global cellular branching for each cell but the probabilistic nature of the method means that it is robust to errors in these global branch labels and can be used to discover early branching genes which diverge before the inferred global cell branching.

While various computational tools using different mathematical methods have been developed to infer clusters, marker genes, and cell lineage, none yet integrate these within a mathematical framework to perform multiple tasks coherently. Such coherence is critical for the inference of cell-cell communication, a major remaining challenge. Here we present similarity matrix-based optimization for single-cell data analysis (SoptSC), in which unsupervised clustering, pseudotemporal ordering, lineage inference, and marker gene identification are inferred via a structured cell-to-cell similarity matrix. SoptSC then predicts cell-cell communication networks, enabling reconstruction of complex cell lineages that include feedback or feedforward interactions. Application of SoptSC to early embryonic development, epidermal regeneration, and hematopoiesis demonstrates robust identification of subpopulations, lineage relationships, and pseudotime, and prediction of pathway-specific cell communication patterns regulating processes of development and differentiation.	1523	4.16974674880219	4	93	3	0.001969796454366382	12.2
10.1101/170118	FALSE	TRUE	Fundamental limits on dynamic inference from single cell snapshots	2017-07-30	Single cell expression profiling reveals the molecular states of individual cells with unprecedented detail. However, because these methods destroy cells in the process of analysis, they cannot measure how gene expression changes over time. But some information on dynamics is present in the data: the continuum of molecular states in the population can reflect the trajectory of a typical cell. Many methods for extracting single cell dynamics from population data have been proposed. However, all such attempts face a common limitation: for any measured distribution of cell states, there are multiple dynamics that could give rise to it, and by extension, multiple possibilities for underlying mechanisms of gene regulation. Here, we describe the aspects of gene expression dynamics that cannot be inferred from a static snapshot alone and identify assumptions necessary to constrain a unique solution for cell dynamics from static snapshots. We translate these constraints into a practical algorithmic approach, Population Balance Analysis (PBA), which makes use of a method from spectral graph theory to solve a class of high dimensional differential equations. We use simulations to show the strengths and limitations of PBA, and then apply it to single-cell profiles of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Cell state predictions from this analysis agree with HPC fate assays reported in several papers over the past two decades. By highlighting the fundamental limits on dynamic inference faced by any method, our framework provides a rigorous basis for dynamic interpretation of a gene expression continuum and clarifies best experimental designs for trajectory reconstruction from static snapshot measurements.Seeing a snapshot of individuals at different stages of a process can reveal what the process would look like for a single individual over time. Biologists apply this principle to infer temporal sequences of gene expression states in cells from measurements made at a single moment in time. However, these inferences are fundamentally under-determined. Using a conservation law, we enumerate reasons that there is no unique dynamics associated with a single snapshot, limiting our ability to infer gene regulatory mechanisms. We then propose a method for dynamic inference that provides a unique dynamic solution under defined approximations and apply it to data from bone marrow stem cells.

Protocols that incorpo-rate both designed and random barcodes have greatly increased the throughput of scRNA-seq, but give rise to a more complex data structure. There is a need for new tools that can handle the various barcoding strategies used by different protocols and exploit this information for quality assessment at the sample-level and provide effective visualization of these results in preparation for higher-level analyses.To this end, we developed scPipe, a R/Bioconductor package that integrates barcode demultiplexing, read alignment, UMI-aware gene-level quantification and quality control of raw sequencing data generated by multiple 3-prime-end sequencing protocols that include CEL-seq, MARS-seq, Chromium 10X and Drop-seq. scPipe produces a count matrix that is essential for downstream analysis along with an HTML report that summarises data quality. These results can be used as input for downstream analyses including normalization, visualization and statistical testing. scPipe performs this processing in a few simple R commands, promoting reproducible analysis of single-cell data that is compatible with the emerging suite of scRNA-seq analysis tools available in R/Bioconductor.

10.1101/177048	FALSE	TRUE	Detection and removal of barcode swapping in single-cell RNA-seq data	2017-08-16	Barcode swapping results in the mislabeling of sequencing reads between multiplexed samples on the new patterned flow cell Illumina sequencing machines. This may compromise the validity of numerous genomic assays, especially for single-cell studies where many samples are routinely multiplexed together. The severity and consequences of barcode swapping for single-cell transcriptomic studies remain poorly understood. We have used two statistical approaches to robustly quantify the fraction of swapped reads in each of two plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. We found that approximately 2.5% of reads were mislabeled between samples on the HiSeq 4000 machine, which is lower than previous reports. We observed no correlation between the swapped fraction of reads and the concentration of free barcode across plates. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that barcode swapping may generate complex but artefactual cell libraries in droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing studies. To eliminate these artefacts, we have developed an algorithm to exclude individual molecules that have swapped between samples in 10X Genomics experiments, exploiting the combinatorial complexity present in the data. This permits the continued use of cutting-edge sequencing machines for droplet-based experiments while avoiding the confounding effects of barcode swapping.	1502	4.112251882272417	5	14	5	0.003328894806924101	28.634

Existing algorithms are either not able to uncover the clustering structures in the data, or lose global information such as groups of clusters that are close to each other. We present a robust statistical model, scvis, to capture and visualize the low-dimensional structures in single-cell gene expression data. Simulation results demonstrate that low-dimensional representations learned by scvis preserve both the local and global neighbour structures in the data. In addition, scvis is robust to the number of data points and learns a probabilistic parametric mapping function to add new data points to an existing embedding. We then use scvis to analyze four single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets, exemplifying interpretable two-dimensional representations of the high-dimensional single-cell RNA-sequencing data.	1486	4.068446269678303	3	56	5	0.0033647375504710633	18.35

Cell-to-cell variability of BCR sequences due to V(D)J recombination and somatic hypermutation (SHM) necessitates single-cell characterization of BCR sequences. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) presents the opportunity for simultaneous capture of the BCR sequence and transcriptomic signature for a detailed understanding of the dynamics of an immune response.We developed VDJPuzzle 2.0, a bioinformatic tool that reconstructs productive, full-length B-cell receptor sequences of both heavy and light chains. VDJPuzzle successfully reconstructs BCRs from 98.3% (n=117) of human and 96.5% (n=200) from murine B cells. 92.0% of clonotypes and 90.3% of mutations were concordant with single-cell Sanger sequencing of the immunoglobulin chains.

10.1101/181479	FALSE	TRUE	DrImpute: Imputing dropout events in single cell RNA sequencing data	2017-08-28	The single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technique began a new era by allowing the observation of gene expression at the single cell level. However, there is also a large amount of technical and biological noise. Because of the low number of RNA transcriptomes and the stochastic nature of the gene expression pattern, there is a high chance of missing nonzero entries as zero, which are called dropout events. However, many statistical methods used for analyzing scRNA-seq data in cell type identification, visualization, and lineage reconstruction do not model for dropout events. We have developed DrImpute to impute dropout events, and it improves many of the statistical tools used for scRNA-seq analysis that do not account for dropout events. Our numerical studies with real data demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method, which has been implemented in R.	1490	4.079397672826831	4	43	8	0.005369127516778523	18.03
10.1101/183863	FALSE	TRUE	Dhaka: Variational Autoencoder for Unmasking Tumor Heterogeneity from Single Cell Genomic Data	2017-09-04	Intra-tumor heterogeneity is one of the key confounding factors in deciphering tumor evolution. Malignant cells exhibit variations in their gene expression, copy numbers, and mutation even when originating from a single progenitor cell. Single cell sequencing of tumor cells has recently emerged as a viable option for unmasking the underlying tumor heterogeneity. However, extracting features from single cell genomic data in order to infer their evolutionary trajectory remains computationally challenging due to the extremely noisy and sparse nature of the data.Here we describe ‘Dhaka’, a variational autoencoder method which transforms single cell genomic data to a reduced dimension feature space that is more efficient in differentiating between (hidden) tumor subpopulations. Our method is general and can be applied to several different types of genomic data including copy number variation from scDNA-Seq and gene expression from scRNA-Seq experiments. We tested the method on synthetic and 6 single cell cancer datasets where the number of cells ranges from 250 to 6000 for each sample. Analysis of the resulting feature space revealed subpopulations of cells and their marker genes. The features are also able to infer the lineage and/or differentiation trajectory between cells greatly improving upon prior methods suggested for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction of such data.All the datasets used in the paper are publicly available and developed software package is available on Github https://github.com/MicrosoftGenomics/Dhaka.Supporting info and Software: https://github.com/MicrosoftGenomics/Dhaka	1483	4.060232717316906	4	43	5	0.0033715441672285905	11.85

10.1101/191056	FALSE	TRUE	Reconstruction of developmental landscapes by optimal-transport analysis of single-cell gene expression sheds light on cellular reprogramming	2017-09-27	Understanding the molecular programs that guide cellular differentiation during development is a major goal of modern biology. Here, we introduce an approach, WADDINGTON-OT, based on the mathematics of optimal transport, for inferring developmental landscapes, probabilistic cellular fates and dynamic trajectories from large-scale single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data collected along a time course. We demonstrate the power of WADDINGTON-OT by applying the approach to study 65,781 scRNA-seq profiles collected at 10 time points over 16 days during reprogramming of fibroblasts to iPSCs. We construct a high-resolution map of reprogramming that rediscovers known features; uncovers new alternative cell fates including neuraland placental-like cells; predicts the origin and fate of any cell class; highlights senescent-like cells that may support reprogramming through paracrine signaling; and implicates regulatory models in particular trajectories. Of these findings, we highlight Obox6, which we experimentally show enhances reprogramming efficiency. Our approach provides a general framework for investigating cellular differentiation.	1460	3.997262149212868	17	124	33	0.022602739726027398	121.414
10.1101/191254	FALSE	TRUE	An Interpretable Framework for Clustering Single-Cell RNA-Seq Datasets	2017-09-21	With the recent proliferation of single-cell RNA-Seq experiments, several methods have been developed for unsupervised analysis of the resulting datasets. These methods often rely on unintuitive hyperparameters and do not explicitly address the subjectivity associated with clustering.In this work, we present DendroSplit, an interpretable framework for analyzing single-cell RNA-Seq datasets that addresses both the clustering interpretability and clustering subjectivity issues. DendroSplit offers a novel perspective on the single-cell RNA-Seq clustering problem motivated by the definition of “cell type,” allowing us to cluster using feature selection to uncover multiple levels of biologically meaningful populations in the data. We analyze several landmark single-cell datasets, demonstrating both the method’s efficacy and computational efficiency.DendroSplit offers a clustering framework that is comparable to existing methods in terms of accuracy and speed but is novel in its emphasis on interpretabilty.

10.1101/197244	FALSE	TRUE	bigSCale: An Analytical Framework for Big-Scale Single-Cell Data	2017-10-03	Single-cell RNA sequencing significantly deepened our insights into complex tissues and latest techniques are capable processing ten-thousands of cells simultaneously. With bigSCale, we provide an analytical framework being scalable to analyze millions of cells, addressing challenges of future large datasets. Unlike previous methods, bigSCale does not constrain data to fit an a priori-defined distribution and instead uses an accurate numerical model of noise. We evaluated the performance of bigSCale using a biological model of aberrant gene expression in patient derived neuronal progenitor cells and simulated datasets, which underlined its speed and accuracy in differential expression analysis. We further applied bigSCale to analyze 1.3 million cells from the mouse developing forebrain. Herein, we identified rare populations, such as Reelin positive Cajal-Retzius neurons, for which we determined a previously not recognized heterogeneity associated to distinct differentiation stages, spatial organization and cellular function. Together, bigSCale presents a perfect solution to address future challenges of large single-cell datasets.Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) significantly deepened our insights into complex tissues by providing high-resolution phenotypes for individual cells. Recent microfluidic-based methods are scalable to ten-thousands of cells, enabling an unbiased sampling and comprehensive characterization without prior knowledge. Increasing cell numbers, however, generates extremely big datasets, which extends processing time and challenges computing resources. Current scRNAseq analysis tools are not designed to analyze datasets larger than from thousands of cells and often lack sensitivity and specificity to identify marker genes for cell populations or experimental conditions. With bigSCale, we provide an analytical framework for the sensitive detection of population markers and differentially expressed genes, being scalable to analyze millions of single cells. Unlike other methods that use simple or mixture probabilistic models with negative binomial, gamma or Poisson distributions to handle the noise and sparsity of scRNAseq data, bigSCale does not constrain the data to fit an a priori-defined distribution. Instead, bigSCale uses large sample sizes to estimate a highly accurate and comprehensive numerical model of noise and gene expression. The framework further includes modules for differential expression (DE) analysis, cell clustering and population marker identification. Moreover, a directed convolution strategy allows processing of extremely large data sets, while preserving the transcript information from individual cells.We evaluate the performance of bigSCale using a biological model for reduced or elevated gene expression levels. Specifically, we perform scRNAseq of 1,920 patient derived neuronal progenitor cells from Williams-Beuren and 7q11.23 microduplication syndrome patients, harboring a deletion or duplication of 7q11.23, respectively. The affected region contains 28 genes whose transcriptional levels vary in line with their allele frequency. BigSCale detects expression changes with respect to cells from a healthy donor and outperforms other methods for single-cell DE analysis in sensitivity. Simulated data sets, underline the performance of bigSCale in DE analysis as it is faster and more sensitive and specific than other methods. The probabilistic model of cell-distances within bigSCale is further suitable for unsupervised clustering and the identification of cell types and subpopulations. Using bigSCale, we identify all major cell types of the somatosensory cortex and hippocampus analyzing 3,005 cells from adult mouse brains. Remarkably, we increase the number of cell population specific marker genes 4-6-fold compared to the original analysis and, moreover, define markers of higher order cell types. These include CD90 (Thy1), a neuronal surface receptor, potentially suitable for isolating intact neurons from complex brain samples.To test its applicability for large data sets, we apply bigSCale on scRNAseq data from 1.3 million cells derived from the pallium of the mouse developing forebrain (E18, 10x Genomics). Our directed down-sampling strategy accumulates transcript counts from cells with similar transcriptional profiles into index cell transcriptomes, thereby defining cellular clusters with improved resolution. Accordingly, index cell clusters provide a rich resource of marker genes for the main brain cell types and less frequent subpopulations. Our analysis of rare populations includes poorly characterized developmental cell types, such as neuron progenitors from the subventricular zone and neocortical Reelin positive neurons known as Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells. The latter represent a transient population which regulates the laminar formation of the developing neocortex and whose malfunctioning causes major neurodevelopmental disorders like autism or schizophrenia. Most importantly, index cell cluster can be deconvoluted to individual cell level for targeted analysis of populations of interest. Through decomposition of Reelin positive neurons, we determined a previously not recognized heterogeneity among CR cells, which we could associate to distinct differentiation stages as well as spatial and functional differences in the developing mouse brain. Specifically, subtypes of CR cells identified by bigSCale express different compositions of NMDA, AMPA and glycine receptor subunits, pointing to subpopulations with distinct membrane properties. Furthermore, we found Cxcl12, a chemokine secreted by the meninges and regulating the tangential migration of CR cells, to be also expressed in CR cells located in the marginal zone of the neocortex, indicating a self-regulated migration capacity.Together, bigSCale presents a perfect solution for the processing and analysis of scRNAseq data from millions of single cells. Its speed and sensitivity makes it suitable to the address future challenges of large single-cell data sets.	1454	3.980835044490075	10	35	6	0.0041265474552957355	37.45
10.1101/199315	FALSE	TRUE	VASC: dimension reduction and visualization of single cell RNA sequencing data by deep variational autoencoder	2017-10-06	Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful technique to analyze the transcriptomic heterogeneities in single cell level. It is an important step for studying cell sub-populations and lineages based on scRNA-seq data by finding an effective low-dimensional representation and visualization of the original data. The scRNA-seq data are much noiser than traditional bulk RNA-Seq: in the single cell level, the transcriptional fluctuations are much larger than the average of a cell population and the low amount of RNA transcripts will increase the rate of technical dropout events. In this study, we proposed VASC (deep Variational Autoencoder for scRNA-seq data), a deep multi-layer generative model, for the unsupervised dimension reduction and visualization of scRNA-seq data. It can explicitly model the dropout events and find the nonlinear hierarchical feature representations of the original data. Tested on twenty datasets, VASC shows superior performances in most cases and broader dataset compatibility compared with four state-of-the-art dimension reduction methods. Then, for a case study of pre-implantation embryos, VASC successfully re-establishes the cell dynamics and identifies several candidate marker genes associated with the early embryo development.	1451	3.972621492128679	2	42	8	0.0055134390075809786	22.764
10.1101/200345	FALSE	TRUE	Assessment of batch-correction methods for scRNA-seq data with a new test metric	2017-10-09	Single-cell transcriptomics is a versatile tool for exploring heterogeneous cell populations. As with all genomics experiments, batch effects can hamper data integration and interpretation. The success of batch effect correction is often evaluated by visual inspection of dimension-reduced representations such as principal component analysis. This is inherently imprecise due to the high number of genes and non-normal distribution of gene expression. Here, we present a k-nearest neighbour batch effect test (kBET, https://github.com/theislab/kBET) to quantitatively measure batch effects. kBET is easier to interpret, more sensitive and more robust than visual evaluation and other measures of batch effects. We use kBET to assess commonly used batch regression and normalisation approaches, and quantify the extent to which they remove batch effects while preserving biological variability. Our results illustrate that batch correction based on log-transformation or scran pooling followed by ComBat reduced the batch effect while preserving structure across data sets. Finally we show that kBET can pinpoint successful data integration methods across multiple data sets, in this case from different publications all charting mouse embryonic development. This has important implications for future data integration efforts, which will be central to projects such as the Human Cell Atlas where data for the same tissue may be generated in multiple locations around the world.[Before final publication, we will upload the R package to Bioconductor]	1448	3.9644079397672827	5	40	15	0.010359116022099447	26.3

We introduce a new, curated ligand-receptor database and a novel regularized score to perform such inferences. For the first time, we try to assess the confidence in predicted ligand-receptor interactions and show that our regularized score outperforms other scoring schemes while controlling false positives. SingleCellSignalR is implemented as an open-access R package accessible to entry-level users and available from https://github.com/SCA-IRCM. Analysis results come in a variety of tabular and graphical formats. For instance, we provide a unique network view integrating all the intercellular interactions, and a function relating receptors to expressed intracellular pathways. A detailed comparison with related tools is conducted. Among various examples, we demonstrate SingleCellSignalR on mouse epidermis data and discover an oriented communication structure from external to basal layers.	654	1.7905544147843941	6	60	1	0.0015290519877675841	2.85
10.1101/2019.12.20.884163	FALSE	TRUE	TENET: Gene network reconstruction using transfer entropy reveals key regulatory factors from single cell transcriptomic data	2019-12-21	Accurate prediction of gene regulatory rules is important towards understanding of cellular processes. Existing computational algorithms devised for bulk transcriptomics typically require a large number of time points to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs), are applicable for a small number of genes, and fail to detect potential causal relationships effectively. Here, we propose a novel approach ‘TENET’ to reconstruct GRNs from single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets. Employing transfer entropy (TE) to measure the amount of causal relationships between genes, TENET predicts large-scale gene regulatory cascades/relationships from scRNAseq data. TENET showed better performance than other GRN reconstructors, in identifying key regulators from public datasets. Specifically from scRNAseq, TENET identified key transcriptional factors in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and during direct cardiomyocytes reprogramming, where other predictors failed. We further demonstrate that known target genes have significantly higher TE values, and TENET predicted higher TE genes were more influenced by the perturbation of their regulator. Using TENET, we identified and validated that Nme2 is a culture condition specific stem cell factor. These results indicate that TENET is uniquely capable of identifying key regulators from scRNAseq data.TENET measures putative causal relationships between genes using transfer entropy.TENET shows outstanding performance in identifying key regulators compared to existing methods.TENET can reveal previously uncharacterized regulators.	645	1.7659137577002053	4	68	1	0.0015503875968992248	13.1

Such methods are labor-intensive and heavily rely on user expertise, which may lead to inconsistent results. We present SCSA, an automatic tool to annotate cell types from scRNA-seq data, based on a score annotation model combining differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and confidence levels of cell markers from both known and user-defined information. Evaluation on real scRNA-seq datasets from different sources with other methods shows that SCSA is able to assign the cells into the correct types at a fully automated mode with a desirable precision.	643	1.7604380561259412	3	34	2	0.003110419906687403	8.35
10.1101/2019.12.28.889956	FALSE	TRUE	Bayesian inference of the gene expression states of single cells from scRNA-seq data	2019-12-29	In spite of a large investment in the development of methodologies for analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data, there is still little agreement on how to best normalize such data, i.e. how to quantify gene expression states of single cells from such data. Starting from a few basic requirements such as that inferred expression states should correct for both intrinsic biological fluctuations and measurement noise, and that changes in expression state should be measured in terms of fold-changes rather than changes in absolute levels, we here derive a unique Bayesian procedure for normalizing single-cell RNA-seq data from first principles. Our implementation of this normalization procedure, called Sanity (SAmpling Noise corrected Inference of Transcription activitY), estimates log expression values and associated errors bars directly from raw UMI counts without any tunable parameters.Comparison of Sanity with other recent normalization methods on a selection of scRNA-seq datasets shows that Sanity outperforms other methods on basic downstream processing tasks such as clustering cells into subtypes and identification of differentially expressed genes. More importantly, we show that all other normalization methods present severely distorted pictures of the data. By failing to account for biological and technical Poisson noise, many methods systematically predict the lowest expressed genes to be most variable in expression, whereas in reality these genes provide least evidence of true biological variability. In addition, by confounding noise removal with lower-dimensional representation of the data, many methods introduce strong spurious correlations of expression levels with the total UMI count of each cell as well as spurious co-expression of genes.	637	1.7440109514031485	3	53	5	0.007849293563579277	34.03
10.1101/2020.01.01.892562	FALSE	TRUE	Overcoming Genetic Drop-outs in Variants-based Lineage Tracing from Single-cell RNA Sequencing Data	2020-01-02	Lineage tracing provides key insights into the fates of individual cells in complex tissues. Recent works on lineage reconstruction based on the single-cell expression data are suitable for short time frames while tracing lineage based on more stable genetic markers is needed for studies that span time scales over months or years. However, variant calling from the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data suffers from “genetic drop-outs”, including low coverage and allelic bias, which presents significant obstacles for lineage reconstruction. Prior studies focused only on mitochondrial (chrM) variants and need to be expanded to the whole genome to capture more variants with clearer physiological meaning. However, non-chrM variants suffer even more severe drop-outs than chrM variants, although drop-outs affect all variants. We developed strategies to overcome genetic drop-outs in scRNA-Seq-derived whole genomic variants for accurate lineage tracing, and we developed SClineger, a Bayesian Hierarchical model, to implement our approach. Our validation analyses on a series of sequencing protocols demonstrated the necessity of correction for genetic drop-outs and consideration of variants in the whole genome, and also showed the improvement that our approach provided. We showed that genetic-based lineage tracing is applicable for single-cell studies of both tumors and non-tumor tissues using our approach, and can reveal novel biological insights not afforded by expressional analyses. Interestingly, we showed that cells of various lineages grew under the spatial constraints of their respective organs during the developmental process. Overall, our work provides a powerful tool that can be applied to the large amounts of already existing scRNA-Seq data to construct the lineage histories of cells and derive new knowledge.	633	1.73305954825462	7	33	0	0	2
10.1101/2020.01.05.895136	FALSE	TRUE	Alignment of single-cell RNA-seq samples without over-correction using kernel density matching	2020-01-06	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology is poised to replace bulk cell RNA sequencing for most biological and medical applications as it allows users to measure gene expression levels in a cell-type-specific manner. However, data produced by scRNA-seq often exhibit batch effects that can be specific to a cell-type, to a sample, or to an experiment, which prevent integration or comparisons across multiple experiments. Here, we present Dmatch, a method that leverages an external expression atlas of human primary cells and kernel density matching to align multiple scRNA-seq experiments for downstream biological analysis. Dmatch facilitates alignment of scRNA-seq datasets with cell-types that may overlap only partially, and thus allows integration of multiple distinct scRNA-seq experiments to extract biological insights. In simulation, Dmatch compares favorably to other alignment methods, both in terms of reducing sample-specific clustering, and in terms of avoiding over-correction. When applied to scRNA-seq data collected from clinical samples in a healthy individual and five autoimmune disease patients, Dmatch enabled cell-type-specific differential gene expression comparisons across biopsy sites and disease conditions, and uncovered a shared population of pro-inflammatory monocytes across biopsy sites in RA patients. We further show that Dmatch increases the number of eQTLs mapped from population scRNA-seq data. Dmatch is fast, scalable, and improves the utility of scRNA-seq for several important applications. Dmatch is freely available online (https://qzhan321.github.io/dmatch/).	629	1.7221081451060918	8	36	2	0.003179650238473768	32.48

Brain organoids or spheroids are complex and can contain cells at various stages of differentiation from different brain structures. Single-cell genomic methods provide powerful approaches to explore cell composition, differentiation trajectories, gene regulation, and genetic perturbations in brain organoid systems. However, it remains a major challenge to understand the cellular heterogeneity observed within and between individual organoids. Here, we have developed a computational approach (VoxHunt) to assess brain organoid patterning, developmental state, and cell composition through systematic comparisons to three-dimensional in situ hybridization data from the Allen Brain Atlas. Cellular transcriptomes as well as accessible chromatin landscapes can be compared to spatial transcript patterns in the developing mammalian brain, which enables characterization and visualization of organoid cell compositions. VoxHunt will be useful to assess novel organoid engineering protocols and to annotate cell fates that emerge in organoids during genetic and environmental perturbation experiments.	628	1.7193702943189597	5	27	2	0.0031847133757961785	29.4
10.1101/2020.01.06.896621	FALSE	TRUE	Supervised Adversarial Alignment of Single-Cell RNA-seq Data	2020-01-07	Dimensionality reduction is an important first step in the analysis of single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. In addition to enabling the visualization of the profiled cells, such representations are used by many downstream analyses methods ranging from pseudo-time reconstruction to clustering to alignment of scRNA-seq data from different experiments, platforms, and labs. Both supervised and unsupervised methods have been proposed to reduce the dimension of scRNA-seq. However, all methods to date are sensitive to batch effects. When batches correlate with cell types, as is often the case, their impact can lead to representations that are batch rather than cell type specific. To overcome this we developed a domain adversarial neural network model for learning a reduced dimension representation of scRNA-seq data. The adversarial model tries to simultaneously optimize two objectives. The first is the accuracy of cell type assignment and the second is the inability to distinguish the batch (domain). We tested the method by using the resulting representation to align several different datasets. As we show, by overcoming batch effects our method was able to correctly separate cell types, improving on several prior methods suggested for this task. Analysis of the top features used by the network indicates that by taking the batch impact into account, the reduced representation is much better able to focus on key genes for each cell type.	628	1.7193702943189597	5	42	2	0.0031847133757961785	11.68

Here we developed BayesPrism, a Bayesian method to jointly predict cellular composition and gene expression in each cell type, including heterogeneous malignant cells, from bulk RNA-seq using scRNA-seq as prior information. We conducted an integrative analysis of 1,412 bulk RNA-seq samples in primary glioblastoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma using single-cell datasets of 85 patients. We identified cell types correlated with clinical outcomes and explored spatial heterogeneity in tumor state and stromal composition. We refined subtypes using gene expression in malignant cells, after excluding confounding non-malignant cell types. Finally, we identified genes whose expression in malignant cells correlated with infiltration of macrophages, T cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells across multiple tumor types. Our work introduces a new lens that uses scRNA-seq to accurately infer cellular composition and expression in large cohorts of bulk data.	627	1.7166324435318274	2	76	3	0.004784688995215311	33.15

Currently, no existing software is aimed at identifying single nucleotide variations or micro (1-50bp) insertions and deletions in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Generating high-quality variant data is vital to the study of the aforementioned diseases, among others. In this study, we report the design and implementation of Red Panda, a novel method to accurately identify variants in scRNA-seq data. Variants were called on scRNA-seq data from human articular chondrocytes, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and simulated data stemming from the MEF alignments.

10.1101/2020.01.13.904649	FALSE	TRUE	SIMPLEs: a single-cell RNA sequencing imputation strategy preserving gene modules and cell clusters variation	2020-01-14	A main challenge in analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) data is to reduce technical variations yet retain cell heterogeneity. Due to low mRNAs content per cell and molecule losses during the experiment (called “dropout”), the gene expression matrix has substantial zero read counts. Existing imputation methods either treat each cell or each gene identically and independently, which oversimplifies the gene correlation and cell type structure. We propose a statistical model-based approach, called SIMPLEs, which iteratively identifies correlated gene modules and cell clusters and imputes dropouts customized for individual gene module and cell type. Simultaneously, it quantifies the uncertainty of imputation and cell clustering. Optionally, SIMPLEs can integrate bulk RNASeq data for estimating dropout rates. In simulations, SIMPLEs performed significantly better than prevailing scRNASeq imputation methods by various metrics. By applying SIMPLEs to several real data sets, we discovered gene modules that can further classify subtypes of cells. Our imputations successfully recovered the expression trends of marker genes in stem cell differentiation and can discover putative pathways regulating biological processes.	621	1.700205338809035	3	31	2	0.00322061191626409	10.08

However, clustering requires upfront algorithm and hyperparameter selection, which can introduce bias into the final clustering labels. It is therefore advisable to obtain a range of clustering results from multiple models and hyperparameters, which can be cumbersome and slow. To streamline this process, we present hypercluster, a python package and SnakeMake pipeline for flexible and parallelized clustering evaluation and selection. Hypercluster is available on bioconda; installation, documentation and example workflows can be found at:https://github.com/ruggleslab/hypercluster.Unsupervised clustering is a technique for grouping similar samples within a dataset. It is extremely common when analyzing big data from patient samples, or high throughput techniques like single cell RNA-seq. When researchers use unsupervised clustering, they have to select parameters that affect the final result—for instance, how many groups they expect to find or what the smallest group is allowed to be. Some methods require setting even less intuitive parameters. For most applications, it is extremely challenging to guess what the values of these parameters should be; therefore to prevent introducing bias into the final results, researchers should test many different parameters and methods to find the best groups. This process is cumbersome, slow and challenging to perform in a reproducible way. We developed hypercluster, a tool that automates this process, make it much faster, and presenting the results in a reproducible and helpful manner.	621	1.700205338809035	2	46	2	0.00322061191626409	31.88

More recently, coupled with the cutting-edge Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq), the droplet-based system has allowed for immunophenotyping of single cells based on cell surface expression of specific proteins together with simultaneous transcriptome profiling in the same cell. Despite the rapid advances in technologies, novel statistical methods and computational tools for analyzing multi-modal CITE-Seq data are lacking. In this study, we developed BREM-SC, a novel Bayesian Random Effects Mixture model that jointly clusters paired single cell transcriptomic and proteomic data. Through simulation studies and analysis of public and in-house real data sets, we successfully demonstrated the validity and advantages of this method in fully utilizing both types of data to accurately identify cell clusters. In addition, as a probabilistic model-based approach, BREM-SC is able to quantify the clustering uncertainty for each single cell. This new method will greatly facilitate researchers to jointly study transcriptome and surface proteins at the single cell level to make new biological discoveries, particularly in the area of immunology.	616	1.6865160848733745	9	23	0	0	9.83

However, it suffers from many sources of technical noises, including insufficient mRNA molecules that lead to excess false zero values, termed dropouts. Computational approaches have been proposed to recover the biologically meaningful expression by borrowing information from similar cells in the observed dataset. However, these methods suffer from oversmoothing and removal of natural cell-to-cell stochasticity in gene expression. Here, we propose the generative adversarial networks (GANs) for scRNA-seq imputation (scIGANs), which uses generated cells rather than observed cells to avoid these limitations and balances the performance between major and rare cell populations. Evaluations based on a variety of simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets show that scIGANs is effective for dropout imputation and enhances various downstream analysis. ScIGANs is robust to small datasets that have very few genes with low expression and/or cell-to-cell variance. ScIGANs works equally well on datasets from different scRNA-seq protocols and is scalable to datasets with over 100,000 cells. We demonstrated in many ways with compelling evidence that scIGANs is not only an application of GANs in omics data but also represents a competing imputation method for the scRNA-seq data.	614	1.68104038329911	6	54	3	0.004885993485342019	10.58

Although the throughput of scRNA-Seq experiments is steadily growing in terms of the number of cells, large datasets are not yet commonly used due to prohibitively high costs. Integrating multiple datasets into one can improve power in scRNA-Seq experiments, and efficient integration is very important for downstream analyses such as identifying cell-type-specific eQTLs. State-of-the-art scRNA-Seq integration methods are based on the mutual nearest neighbors paradigm and fail to both correct for batch effects and maintain the local structure of the datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel scRNA-Seq dataset integration method called BATMAN (BATch integration via minimum-weight MAtchiNg). Across multiple simulations and real datasets, we show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tools with respect to existing metrics for batch effects by up to 80% while retaining cell-to-cell relationships.

10.1101/2020.01.25.919829	FALSE	TRUE	CCSN: Single Cell RNA Sequencing Data Analysis by Conditional Cell-specific Network	2020-01-26	The rapid advancement of single cell technologies has shed new light on the complex mechanisms of cellular heterogeneity. However, compared with bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) suffers from higher noise and lower coverage, which brings new computational difficulties. Based on statistical independence, cell-specific network (CSN) is able to quantify the overall associations between genes for each cell, yet suffering from a problem of overestimation related to indirect effects. To overcome this problem, we propose the “conditional cell-specific network” (CCSN) method, which can measure the direct associations between genes by eliminating the indirect associations. CCSN can be used for cell clustering and dimension reduction on a network basis of single cells. Intuitively, each CCSN can be viewed as the transformation from less “reliable” gene expression to more “reliable” gene-gene associations in a cell. Based on CCSN, we further design network flow entropy (NFE) to estimate the differentiation potency of a single cell. A number of scRNA-seq datasets were used to demonstrate the advantages of our approach: (1) one direct association network for one cell; (2) most existing scRNA-seq methods designed for gene expression matrices are also applicable to CCSN-transformed degree matrices; (3) CCSN-based NFE helps resolving the direction of differentiation trajectories by quantifying the potency of each cell.

10.1101/2020.01.31.927921	FALSE	TRUE	Non-negative Independent Factor Analysis for single cell RNA-seq	2020-02-02	Single-cell RNA-seq analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding inter-cellular heterogeneity. Due to the inherent noise of the data, computational techniques often rely on dimensionality reduction (DR) as both a pre-processing step and an analysis tool. Ideally, dimensionality reduction should preserve the biological information while discarding the noise. However if the dimensionality reduction is to be used directly to gain biological insight it must also be interpretable – that is the individual dimensions of the reduction should correspond to specific biological variables such as cell-type identity or pathway activity. Maximizing biological interpretability necessitates making assumption about the data structures and the choice of the model is critical.We present a new probabilistic single-cell factor analysis model, Non-negative Independent Factor Analysis (NIFA), that incorporates different interpretability inducing assumptions into a single modeling framework. The key advantage of our NIFA model is that it simultaneously models uni- and multi-modal latent factors, and thus isolates discrete cell-type identity and continuous pathway activity into separate components. We apply our approach to a range of datasets where cell-type identity is known, and we show that NIFA-derived factors outperform results from ICA, PCA, NMF and scCoGAPS (an NMF method designed for single-cell data) in terms of disentangling biological sources of variation. Studying an immunotherapy dataset in detail, we show that NIFA is able to reproduce and refine previous findings in a single analysis framework and enables the discovery of new clinically relevant cell states.NFIA is a R package which is freely available at GitHub (https://github.com/wgmao/NIFA).mchikina@pitt.eduSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	602	1.648186173853525	4	28	0	0	22.38

However, an emerging challenge is to uncover how different cell types communicate with each other to maintain tissue homeostasis, and how inter-cellular communications are perturbed in diseases. To address this problem, we developed talklr, an information theory-based approach to uncover potential ligand-receptor interactions involved in tissue homeostasis and diseases. Compared to existing approaches that analyze changes in each gene in each cell type separately, talklr uses a holistic approach to simultaneously consider expression changes in both ligands and receptors across multiple cell types and conditions. talklr outperformed existing approaches in identifying ligand-receptor interactions, including those known to be important for tissue-specific functions and diseases across diverse datasets. talklr can reveal important signaling events in many biological problems in an unbiased way, and will be a valuable tool in single cell RNA-seq analysis. talklr is available as both an interactive website and an R package.	602	1.648186173853525	1	46	2	0.0033222591362126247	1.5

Numerous benchmark studies already exist and cover most of scRNAseq processing and analytical methods but only a few give advice on a comprehensive pipeline. Moreover, current studies often focused on isolated steps of the process and do not address the impact of a tool on both the intermediate and the final steps of the analysis. Here, we present a flexible R framework for pipeline comparison with multi-level evaluation metrics. We apply it to the benchmark of scRNAseq analysis pipelines using simulated and real datasets with known cell identities, covering common methods of filtering, doublet detection, normalization, feature selection, denoising, dimensionality reduction and clustering. We evaluate the choice of these tools with multi-purpose metrics to assess their ability to reveal cell population structure and lead to efficient clustering. On the basis of our systematic evaluations of analysis pipelines, we make a number of practical recommendations about current analysis choices and for a comprehensive pipeline. The evaluation framework that we developed, pipeComp (https://github.com/plger/pipeComp), has been implemented so as to easily integrate any other step, tool, or evaluation metric allowing extensible benchmarks and easy applications to other fields of research in Bioinformatics, as we demonstrate through a study of the impact of removal of unwanted variation on differential expression analysis.	602	1.648186173853525	3	61	4	0.006644518272425249	49.75

However, single-cell multi-omics datasets consist of unpaired cells measured with distinct unmatched features across modalities, making data integration challenging. In this study, we present a novel algorithm, termed UnionCom, for the unsupervised topological alignment of single-cell multi-omics integration. UnionCom does not require any correspondence information, either among cells or among features. It first embeds the intrinsic low-dimensional structure of each single-cell dataset into a distance matrix of cells within the same dataset and then aligns the cells across single-cell multi-omics datasets by matching the distance matrices via a matrix optimization method. Finally, it projects the distinct unmatched features across single-cell datasets into a common embedding space for feature comparability of the aligned cells. To match the complex nonlinear geometrical distorted low-dimensional structures across datasets, UnionCom proposes and adjusts a global scaling parameter on distance matrices for aligning similar topological structures. It does not require one-to-one correspondence among cells across datasets, and it can accommodate samples with dataset-specific cell types. UnionCom outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real single-cell multi-omics datasets. UnionCom is robust to parameter choices, as well as subsampling of features.

However, it remains challenging to cluster single cells of the same tissue origin across scRNA- and scDNA-seq platforms. In this work, we present a computational framework – CCNMF, which uses a novel Coupled-Clone Non-negative Matrix Factorization technique to jointly infer clonal structure for paired scDNA- and scRNA-seq data of the same specimen. CCNMF clusters single cells through statistically modeling their shared clonal structure and coupling copy number and gene expression profiles by their global correlation. We validated CCNMF using both simulated and real cell mixture benchmarks and fully demonstrated its robustness and accuracy. As real world applications of CCNMF, we analyzed data from a gastric cancer cell line, an ovarian cancer cell mixture, and a triple-negative breast cancer xenograft. We resolved the underlying clonal structures and identified dosage-sensitive genes between co-existing clones. In summary, CCNMF is a coherent computational framework that simul-taneously resolves genome and transcriptome clonal structures, facilitating understanding of how cellular gene expression changes along with clonal genome alternations.The R package of CCNMF is available at https://github.com/XQBai/CCNMF.	599	1.6399726214921286	4	43	1	0.001669449081803005	15.58

However, in scRNA-seq studies, only a low amount of sequenced mRNA in each cell leads to missing detection for a portion of mRNA molecules, i.e. the dropout problem. The dropout event hinders various downstream analysis, such as clustering analysis, differential expression analysis, and inference of gene-to-gene relationships. Therefore, it is necessary to develop robust and effective imputation methods for the increasing scRNA-seq data. In this study, we have developed an imputation method (GraphSCI) to impute the dropout events in scRNA-seq data based on the graph convolution networks. The method takes advantage of low-dimensional representations of similar cells and gene-gene interactions to impute the dropouts. Extensive experiments demonstrated that GraphSCI outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for imputation on both simulated and real scRNA-seq data. Meanwhile, GraphSCI is able to accurately infer gene-to-gene relationships by utilizing the imputed matrix that are concealed by dropout events in raw data.	599	1.6399726214921286	5	31	5	0.008347245409015025	10.43

Here we propose a general approach to these problems that operates directly on a given metric of cell-cell similarity, allowing for its integration with any method (linear or non linear) for identifying the primary axes of transcriptional variation between cells. Additionally, we show that when using multimodal data, our procedure can be used to identify genes whose expression reflects alternative notions of similarity between cells, such as physical proximity in a tissue or clonal relatedness in a cell lineage tree. In this manner, we demonstrate that while our method, called Hotspot, is capable of identifying genes that reflect nuanced transcriptional variability between T helper cells, it can also identify spatially-dependent patterns of gene expression in the cerebellum as well as developmentally-heritable expression signatures during embryogenesis.	597	1.6344969199178645	2	36	8	0.01340033500837521	8.58

We used simulated data to benchmark scTenifoldNet’s performance, and then applied scTenifoldNet to several real data sets. In real-data applications, scTenifoldNet identified highly specific changes in gene regulation in response to acute morphine treatment, an antibody anticancer drug, gene knockout, double-stranded RNA stimulus, and amyloid-beta plaques in various types of mouse and human cells.

We show that CSOmap can successfully recapitulate the spatial organization of tumor microenvironments for multiple cancers and reveal molecular determinants of cellular interactions. Further, CSOmap readily simulates perturbation of genes or cell types to gain novel biological insights, especially into how immune cells interact in the tumor microenvironment. CSOmap can be widely applicable to interrogate cellular organizations based on scRNA-seq data for various tissues in diverse systems.	590	1.6153319644079398	6	41	2	0.003389830508474576	6.2

Single-cell technologies enable the dissection of tissue composition on a cell-by-cell basis in complex biological systems. However, highly-sparse single-cell RNA-seq data poses challenges for cell-type identification algorithms based on bulk RNA-seq. Single-cell analytical tools are also limited, where they require prior biological knowledge and typically classify cells in a discrete, categorical manner. Here, we present a computational tool, ‘Capybara,’ designed to measure cell identity as a continuum, at single-cell resolution. This approach enables the classification of discrete cell entities but also identifies cells harboring multiple identities, supporting a metric to quantify cell fate transition dynamics. We benchmark the performance of Capybara against other existing classifiers and demonstrate its efficacy to annotate cells and identify critical transitions within a well-characterized differentiation hierarchy, hematopoiesis. Our application of Capybara to a range of reprogramming strategies reveals previously uncharacterized regional patterning and identifies a putativein vivocorrelate for an engineered cell type that has, to date, remained undefined.

We validate the efficacy of CellOracle to recapitulate known regulatory changes across hematopoiesis, correctly predicting the outcomes of well-characterized TF perturbations. Integrating CellOracle analysis with lineage tracing of direct reprogramming reveals distinct network configurations underlying different reprogramming failure modes. Furthermore, analysis of GRN reconfiguration along successful reprogramming trajectories identifies new factors to enhance target cell yield, uncovering a role for the AP-1 subunit Fos, with the hippo signaling effector, Yap1. Together, these results demonstrate the efficacy of CellOracle to infer and interpret cell-type-specific GRN configurations, at high-resolution, promoting new mechanistic insights into the regulation and reprogramming of cell identity.	587	1.6071184120465434	3	81	12	0.020442930153321975	62.58

Although scRNA-seq provides unprecedented insights into the biology of heterogeneous cell populations, analyzing such data on a gene-by-gene basis is challenging due to the large number of tested hypotheses, high level of technical noise and inflated zero counts. One promising approach for addressing these challenges is gene set testing, or pathway analysis. By combining the expression data for all genes in a pathway, gene set testing can mitigate the impacts of sparsity and noise and improve interpretation, replication and statistical power. Unfortunately, statistical and biological differences between single cell and bulk expression measurements make it challenging to use gene set testing methods originally developed for bulk tissue on scRNA-seq data and progress on single cell-specific methods has been limited. To address this challenge, we have developed a new gene set testing method, variance-adjusted Mahalanobis (VAM), that seamlessly integrates with the Seurat framework and is designed to accommodate the technical noise, sparsity and large sample sizes characteristic of scRNA-seq data. The VAM method computes cell-specific pathway scores to transform a cell-by-gene matrix into a cell-by-pathway matrix that can be used for both exploratory data visualization and statistical gene set enrichment analysis. Because the distribution of these scores under the null of uncorrelated technical noise has an accurate gamma approximation, inference can be performed at both the population and single cell levels. As we demonstrate using both simulation studies and real data analyses, the VAM method provides superior classification accuracy at a lower computation cost relative to existing single sample gene set testing approaches.	585	1.6016427104722792	1	52	0	0	10.93

Here we integrated experiments and computational analysis to reveal two major noise sources: protein-specific noise from unbound antibodies and cell-specific noise captured by the shared variance of isotype controls and background protein counts. We provide an open source R package (dsb) to denoise and normalize CITE-seq data based on these findings.

10.1101/2020.02.25.960302	FALSE	TRUE	Discovering Novel Cell Types across Heterogeneous Single-cell Experiments	2020-02-26	Although tremendous effort has been put into cell type annotation and classification, identification of previously uncharacterized cell types in heterogeneous single-cell RNA-seq data remains a challenge. Here we present MARS, a meta-learning approach for identifying and annotating known as well as novel cell types. MARS overcomes the heterogeneity of cell types by transferring latent cell representations across multiple datasets. MARS uses deep learning to learn a cell embedding function as well as a set of landmarks in the cell embedding space. The method annotates cells by probabilistically defining a cell type based on nearest landmarks in the embedding space. MARS has a unique ability to discover cell types that have never been seen before and annotate experiments that are yet unannotated. We apply MARS to a large aging cell atlas of 23 tissues covering the life span of a mouse. MARS accurately identifies cell types, even when it has never seen them before. Further, the method automatically generates interpretable names for novel cell types. Remarkably, MARS estimates meaningful cell-type-specific signatures of aging and visualizes them as trajectories reflecting temporal relationships of cells in a tissue.	578	1.5824777549623545	7	43	5	0.00865051903114187	10.05
10.1101/2020.02.27.968560	FALSE	TRUE	Cluster similarity spectrum integration of single-cell genomics data	2020-02-28	Technologies to sequence the transcriptome, genome or epigenome from thousands of single cells in an experiment provide extraordinary resolution into the molecular states present within a complex biological system at any given moment. However, it is a major challenge to integrate single-cell sequencing data across experiments, conditions, batches, timepoints and other technical considerations. New computational methods are required that can integrate samples while simultaneously preserving biological information. Here, we propose an unsupervised reference-free data representation, Cluster Similarity Spectrum (CSS), where each cell is represented by its similarities to clusters independently identified across samples. We show that CSS can be used to assess cellular heterogeneity and enable reconstruction of differentiation trajectories from cerebral organoid single-cell transcriptomic data, and to integrate data across experimental conditions and human individuals. We compare CSS to other integration algorithms and show that it can outperform other methods in certain integration scenarios. We also show that CSS allows projection of single-cell genomic data of different modalities to the CSS-represented reference atlas for visualization and cell type identity prediction. In summary, CSS provides a straightforward and powerful approach to understand and integrate challenging single-cell multi-omic data.	576	1.5770020533880904	5	25	2	0.003472222222222222	32.7
10.1101/2020.02.28.970202	FALSE	TRUE	Optimal tuning of weighted kNN- and diffusion-based methods for denoising single cell genomics data	2020-03-02	The analysis of single-cell genomics data presents several statistical challenges, and extensive efforts have been made to produce methods for the analysis of this data that impute missing values, address sampling issues and quantify and correct for noise. In spite of such efforts, no consensus on best practices has been established and all current approaches vary substantially based on the available data and empirical tests. The k-Nearest Neighbor Graph (kNN-G) is often used to infer the identities of, and relationships between, cells and is the basis of many widely used dimensionality-reduction and projection methods. The kNN-G has also been the basis for imputation methods using, e.g., neighbor averaging and graph diffusion. However, due to the lack of an agreed-upon optimal objective function for choosing hyperparameters, these methods tend to oversmooth data, thereby resulting in a loss of information with regard to cell identity and the specific gene-to-gene patterns underlying regulatory mechanisms. In this paper, we investigate the tuning of kNN- and diffusion-based denoising methods with a novel non-stochastic method for optimally preserving biologically relevant informative variance in single-cell data. The framework, Denoising Expression data with a Weighted Affinity Kernel and Self-Supervision (DEWÄKSS), uses a self-supervised technique to tune its parameters. We demonstrate that denoising with optimal parameters selected by our objective function (i) is robust to preprocessing methods using data from established benchmarks, (ii) disentangles cellular identity and maintains robust clusters over dimension-reduction methods, (iii) maintains variance along several expression dimensions, unlike previous heuristic-based methods that tend to oversmooth data variance, and (iv) rarely involves diffusion but rather uses a fixed weighted kNN graph for denoising. Together, these findings provide a new understanding of kNN- and diffusion-based denoising methods and serve as a foundation for future research. Code and example data for DEWÄKSS is available at https://gitlab.com/Xparx/dewakss/-/tree/Tjarnberg2020branch.	573	1.568788501026694	7	42	1	0.0017452006980802793	19.23
10.1101/2020.03.03.974220	FALSE	TRUE	Improving replicability in single-cell RNA-Seq cell type discovery with Dune	2020-03-04	Single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has allowed many new types of investigations at unprecedented and unique levels of resolution. Among the primary goals of scRNA-Seq is the classification of cells into potentially novel cell types. Many approaches build on the existing clustering literature to develop tools specific to single-cell applications. However, almost all of these methods rely on heuristics or user-supplied parameters to control the number of clusters identified. This affects both the resolution of the clusters within the original dataset as well as their replicability across datasets. While many recommendations exist to select these tuning parameters, most of them are quite ad hoc. In general, there is little assurance that any given set of parameters will represent an optimal choice in the ever-present trade-off between cluster resolution and replicability. For instance, it may be the case that another set of parameters will result in more clusters that are also more replicable, or in fewer clusters that are also less replicable.Here, we propose a new method calledDunefor optimizing the trade-off between the resolution of the clusters and their replicability across datasets. Our method takes as input a set of clustering results on a single dataset, derived from any set of clustering algorithms and associated tuning parameters, and iteratively merges clusters within partitions in order to maximize their concordance between partitions. As demonstrated on a variety of scRNA-Seq datasets from different platforms,Duneoutperforms existing techniques, that rely on hierarchical merging for reducing the number of clusters, in terms of replicability of the resultant merged clusters. It provides an objective approach for identifying replicable consensus clusters most likely to represent common biological features across multiple datasets.	571	1.5633127994524298	10	38	0	0	20.38

However, important challenges remain: 1) global integration of cell-to-cell communication, 2) biological interpretation, and 3) application to individual cell population transcriptomic profiles. We developed ICELLNET, a transcriptomic-based framework integrating: 1) an original expert-curated database of ligand-receptor interactions accounting for multiple subunits expression, 2) quantification of communication scores, 3) the possibility to connect a cell population of interest with 31 reference human cell types (BioGPS), and 4) three visualization modes to facilitate biological interpretation. We applied ICELLNET to uncover different communication in breast cancer associated fibroblast (CAF) subsets. ICELLNET also revealed autocrine IL-10 as a switch to control human dendritic cell communication with up to 12 other cell types, four of which were experimentally validated. In summary, ICELLNET is a global, versatile, biologically validated, and easy-to-use framework to dissect cell communication from single or multiple cell-based transcriptomic profile(s).	570	1.5605749486652978	9	49	7	0.012280701754385965	2.2

In this manuscript, we developed a computational method, called redPATH, to reconstruct the pseudo developmental time of cell lineages using a consensus asymmetric Hamiltonian path algorithm. Besides, we implemented a novel approach to visualize the trajectory development of cells and visualization methods to provide biological insights. We validated the performance of redPATH by segmenting different stages of cell development on multiple neural stem cell and cancerous datasets, as well as other single-cell transcriptome data. In particular, we identified a subpopulation of malignant glioma cells, which are stem cell-like. These cells express known proliferative markers such asGFAP(also identifiedATP1A2,IGFBPL1,ALDOC) and remain silenced in quiescent markers such asID3. Furthermore,MCL1is identified as a significant gene that regulates cell apoptosis, andCSF1Rconfirms previous studies for re-programming macrophages to control tumor growth. In conclusion, redPATH is a comprehensive tool for analyzing single-cell RNA-Seq datasets along a pseudo developmental time.

10.1101/2020.03.06.977728	FALSE	TRUE	A bivariate zero-inflated negative binomial model for identifying underlying dependence with application to single cell RNA sequencing data	2020-03-07	The zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) distribution has been widely used for count data analyses in various biomedical settings due to its capacity of modeling excess zeros and overdispersion. When there are correlated count variables, a bivariate model is essential for understanding their full distributional features. For this purpose, we develop a Bivariate Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (BZINB) model that has a simple latent variable framework and parameters with intuitive interpretations. Using this model, we examine two biomedical data examples where the counts are zero-inflated—single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data and dental caries count indices. In scRNA-seq data example, a correlation between a pair of genes is estimated after adjusting for the effects of dropout events represented by excess zeros. In the dental caries data, we analyze how the treatment with Xylitol mints affects the marginal mean and other patterns of response manifested in the two dental caries traits. An R package ‘bzinb’ is available on CRAN.	568	1.5550992470910336	4	42	0	0	3
10.1101/2020.03.23.002758	FALSE	TRUE	Knowledge-based classification of fine-grained immune cell types in single-cell RNA-Seq data with ImmClassifier	2020-03-25	Single-cell RNA sequencing is an emerging strategy for characterizing the immune cell population in diverse environments including blood, tumor or healthy tissues. While this has traditionally been done with flow or mass cytometry targeting protein expression, scRNA-Seq has several established and potential advantages in that it can profile immune cells and non-immune cells (e.g. cancer cells) in the same sample, identify cell types that lack precise markers for flow cytometry, or identify a potentially larger number of immune cell types and activation states than is achievable in a single flow assay. However, scRNA-Seq is currently limited due to the need to identify the types of each immune cell from its transcriptional profile, which is not only time-consuming but also requires a significant knowledge of immunology. While recently developed algorithms accurately annotate coarse cell types (e.g. T cells vs macrophages), making fine distinctions has turned out to be a difficult challenge. To address this, we developed a machine learning classifier called ImmClassifier that leverages a hierarchical ontology of cell type. We demonstrate that ImmClassifier outperforms other tools (+20% recall, +14% precision) in distinguishing fine-grained cell types (e.g. CD8+ effector memory T cells) with comparable performance on coarse ones. Thus, ImmClassifier can be used to explore more deeply the heterogeneity of the immune system in scRNA-Seq experiments.	550	1.5058179329226558	8	47	0	0	1.25
10.1101/2020.03.27.010124	FALSE	TRUE	Hierarchical progressive learning of cell identities in single-cell data	2020-03-29	Supervised methods are increasingly used to identify cell populations in single-cell data. Yet, current methods are limited in their ability to learn from multiple datasets simultaneously, are hampered by the annotation of datasets at different resolutions, and do not preserve annotations when retrained on new datasets. The latter point is especially important as researchers cannot rely on downstream analysis performed using earlier versions of the dataset. Here, we present scHPL, a hierarchical progressive learning method which allows continuous learning from single-cell data by leveraging the different resolutions of annotations across multiple datasets to learn and continuously update a classification tree. We evaluate the classification and tree learning performance using simulated as well as real datasets and show that scHPL can successfully learn known cellular hierarchies from multiple datasets while preserving the original annotations. scHPL is available at https://github.com/lcmmichielsen/hierarchicalprogressivelearning.	546	1.4948665297741273	3	41	1	0.0018315018315018315	3.35

Most current clustering methods are designed for one data type only, such as scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq or sc-methylation data alone, and a few are developed for the integrative analysis of multiple data types. Integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell genomic data sets leverages the power in multiple data sets and can deepen the biological insight. We propose a coupled co-clustering-based unsupervised transfer learning algorithm (coupleCoC) for the integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell data. Our proposed coupleCoC builds upon the information theoretic co-clustering framework. We applied coupleCoC for the integrative analysis of scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data, sc-methylation and scRNA-seq data, and scRNA-seq data from mouse and human. We demonstrate that coupleCoC improves the overall clustering performance and matches the cell subpopulations across multimodal single-cell genomic data sets.

However, there is a lack of analytical methods for de novo construction of signal transduction pathways using single-cell omics data. Here we present CytoTalk, a computational method for de novo constructing cell type-specific signal transduction networks using single-cell RNA-Seq data. CytoTalk first constructs intracellular and intercellular gene-gene interaction networks using an information-theoretic measure between two cell types. Candidate signal transduction pathways in the integrated network are identified using the prize-collecting Steiner forest algorithm. We applied CytoTalk to a single-cell RNA-Seq data set on mouse visual cortex and evaluated predictions using high-throughput spatial transcriptomics data generated from the same tissue. Compared to published methods, genes in our inferred signaling pathways have significantly higher spatial expression correlation only in cells that are spatially closer to each other, suggesting improved accuracy of CytoTalk. Furthermore, using single-cell RNA-Seq data with receptor gene perturbation, we found that predicted pathways are enriched for differentially expressed genes between the receptor knockout and wild type cells, further validating the accuracy of CytoTalk. In summary, CytoTalk enables de novo construction of signal transduction pathways and facilitates comparative analysis of these pathways across tissues and conditions.	545	1.4921286789869952	4	46	1	0.001834862385321101	22
10.1101/2020.03.30.015925	FALSE	TRUE	SCHNEL: Scalable clustering of high dimensional single-cell data	2020-03-31	Single cell data measures multiple cellular markers at the single-cell level for thousands to millions of cells. Identification of distinct cell populations is a key step for further biological understanding, usually performed by clustering this data. Dimensionality reduction based clustering tools are either not scalable to large datasets containing millions of cells, or not fully automated requiring an initial manual estimation of the number of clusters. Graph clustering tools provide automated and reliable clustering for single cell data, but suffer heavily from scalability to large datasets.We developed SCHNEL, a scalable, reliable and automated clustering tool for high-dimensional single-cell data. SCHNEL transforms large high-dimensional data to a hierarchy of datasets containing subsets of data points following the original data manifold. The novel approach of SCHNEL combines this hierarchical representation of the data with graph clustering, making graph clustering scalable to millions of cells. Using seven different cytometry datasets, SCHNEL outperformed three popular clustering tools for cytometry data, and was able to produce meaningful clustering results for datasets of 3.5 and 17.2 million cells within workable timeframes. In addition, we show that SCHNEL is a general clustering tool by applying it to single-cell RNA sequencing data, as well as a popular machine learning benchmark dataset MNIST.Implementation is available on GitHub (https://github.com/paulderaadt/HSNE-clustering)a.mahfouz@lumc.nlSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	544	1.4893908281998631	5	34	1	0.001838235294117647	11.58
10.1101/2020.03.31.018911	FALSE	TRUE	Demystifying “drop-outs” in single cell UMI data	2020-04-01	Analysis of scRNA-seq data has been challenging particularly because of excessive zeros observed in UMI counts. Prevalent opinions are that many of the detected zeros are “drop-outs” that occur during experiments and that those zeros should be accounted for through procedures such as normalization, variance stabilization, and imputation. Here, we extensively analyze publicly available UMI datasets and challenge the existing scRNA-seq workflows. Our results strongly suggest that resolving cell-type heterogeneity should be the foremost step of the scRNA-seq analysis pipeline because once cell-type heterogeneity is resolved, “drop-outs” disappear. Additionally, we show that the simplest parametric count model, Poisson, is sufficient to fully leverage the biological information contained in the UMI data, thus offering a more optimistic view of the data analysis. However, if the cell-type heterogeneity is not appropriately taken into account, pre-processing such as normalization or imputation becomes inappropriate and can introduce unwanted noise. Inspired by these analyses, we propose a zero inflation test that can select gene features contributing to cell-type heterogeneity. We integrate feature selection and clustering into iterative pre-processing in our novel, efficient, and straightforward framework for UMI analysis, HIPPO (Heterogeneity Inspired Pre-Processing tOol). HIPPO leads to downstream analysis with much better interpretability than alternatives in our comparative studies.	543	1.486652977412731	3	37	1	0.001841620626151013	33.9
10.1101/2020.03.31.019109	FALSE	TRUE	iCellR: Combined Coverage Correction and Principal Component Alignment for Batch Alignment in Single-Cell Sequencing Analysis	2020-04-01	Under-sampling RNA molecules and low-coverage sequencing in some single cell sequencing technologies introduce zero counts (also known as drop-outs) into the expression matrices. This issue may complicate the processes of dimensionality reduction and clustering, often forcing distinct cell types to falsely resemble one another, while eliminating subtle, but important differences. Considering the wide range in drop-out rates from different sequencing technologies, it can also affect the analysis at the time of batch/sample alignment and other downstream analyses. Therefore, generating an additional harmonized gene expression matrix is important. To address this, we introduce two separate batch alignment methods: Combined Coverage Correction Alignment (CCCA) and Combined Principal Component Alignment (CPCA). The first method uses a coverage correction approach (analogous to imputation) in a combined or joint fashion between multiple samples for batch alignment, while also correcting for drop-outs in a harmonious way. The second method (CPCA) skips the coverage correction step and uses k nearest neighbors (KNN) for aligning the PCs from the nearest neighboring cells in multiple samples. Our results of nine scRNA-seq PBMC samples from different batches and technologies shows the effectiveness of both these methods. All of our algorithms are implemented in R, deposited into CRAN, and available in the iCellR package.	543	1.486652977412731	8	13	4	0.007366482504604052	6

Single cell RNA-seq is revolutionizing transcriptomics and is enabling interindividual differential gene expression analysis and identification of genetic variants associated with gene expression, so called expression quantitative trait loci at cell-type resolution. Current methods for power analysis and guidance of experimental design either do not account for the specific characteristics of single cell data or are not suitable to model interindividual comparisons.Here we present a statistical framework for experimental design and power analysis of single cell differential gene expression between groups of individuals and expression quantitative trait locus analysis. The model relates sample size, number of cells per individual and sequencing depth to the power of detecting differentially expressed genes within individual cell types. Power analysis is based on data driven priors from literature or pilot experiments across a wide range of application scenarios and single cell RNA-seq platforms. Using these priors we show that, for a fixed budget, the number of cells per individual is the major determinant of power.Our model is general and allows for systematic comparison of alternative experimental designs and can thus be used to guide experimental design to optimize power. For a wide range of applications, shallow sequencing of high numbers of cells per individual leads to higher overall power than deep sequencing of fewer cells. The model is implemented as an R package scPower.	542	1.483915126625599	7	89	4	0.007380073800738007	59

However, prevalent dropout events result in high data sparsity and noise that may obscure downstream analyses. We propose a novel method, G2S3, that imputes dropouts by borrowing information from adjacent genes in a sparse gene graph learned from gene expression profiles across cells. We applied G2S3 and other existing methods to seven single-cell datasets to compare their performance. Our results demonstrated that G2S3 is superior in recovering true expression levels, identifying cell subtypes, improving differential expression analyses, and recovering gene regulatory relationships, especially for mildly expressed genes.	541	1.4811772758384667	5	32	1	0.0018484288354898336	8.58

However, current single-cell GRN analysis methods produce only a single GRN per input dataset, potentially missing relationships between cells from different phenotypes. To address this issue, we present SimiC, a single-cell GRN inference method that produces a GRN per phenotype while imposing a similarity constraint that forces a smooth transition between GRNs, allowing for a direct comparison between different states, treatments, or conditions. We show that jointly inferring GRNs can uncover variation in regulatory relationships across phenotypes that would have otherwise been missed. Moreover, SimiC can recapitulate complex regulatory dynamics across a range of systems, both model and non-model alike. Taken together, we establish a new approach to quantitating regulatory architectures between the GRNs of distinct cellular phenotypes, with far-reaching implications for systems biology.	540	1.4784394250513346	12	73	0	0	11.58

A key challenge in realizing this potential is integrating single-cell datasets from multiple protocols, biological contexts, and data modalities into a joint definition of cellular identity. We previously developed an approach called Linked Inference of Genomic Experimental Relationships (LIGER) that uses integrative nonnegative matrix factorization to address this challenge. Here, we provide a step-by-step protocol for using LIGER to jointly define cell types from multiple single-cell datasets. The main steps of the protocol include data preprocessing and normalization, joint factorization, quantile normalization and joint clustering, and visualization. We describe how to jointly define cell types from single-cell RNA-seq and single-nucleus ATAC-seq data, but similar steps apply across a wide range of other settings and data types, including cross-species analysis, single-nucleus DNA methylation, and spatial transcriptomics. Our protocol contains examples of expected results, describes common pitfalls, and relies only on our freely available, open-source R implementation of LIGER. We also provide Rmarkdown tutorials showing the outputs from each individual code segment. The analysis process can be performed in 1 - 4 h depending on dataset size and assumes no specialized bioinformatics training.	536	1.4674880219028064	6	16	1	0.0018656716417910447	14.18

However, while well-established solutions are accessible for the processing of single-cell transcriptomes, no streamlined pipelines are available for the comprehensive characterization of T cell receptors.

10.1101/2020.04.10.035899	FALSE	TRUE	A Bayesian framework for inter-cellular information sharing improves dscRNA-seq quantification	2020-04-13	Droplet based single cell RNA-seq (dscRNA-seq) data is being generated at an unprecedented pace, and the accurate estimation of gene level abundances for each cell is a crucial first step in most dscRNA-seq analyses. When preprocessing the raw dscRNA-seq data to generate a count matrix, care must be taken to account for the potentially large number of multi-mapping locations per read. The sparsity of dscRNA-seq data, and the strong 3’ sampling bias, makes it difficult to disambiguate cases where there is no uniquely mapping read to any of the candidate target genes.We introduce a Bayesian framework for information sharing across cells within a sample, or across multiple modalities of data using the same sample, to improve gene quantification estimates for dscRNA-seq data. We use an anchor-based approach to connect cells with similar gene expression patterns, and learn informative, empirical priors which we provide to alevin’s gene multi-mapping resolution algorithm. This improves the quantification estimates for genes with no uniquely mapping reads (i.e. when there is no unique intra-cellular information). We show our new model improves the per cell gene level estimates and provides a principled framework for information sharing across multiple modalities. We test our method on a combination of simulated and real datasets under various setups.The information sharing model is included in alevin and is implemented in C++14.

10.1101/2020.04.12.022806	FALSE	TRUE	An analytical framework for interpretable and generalizable 'quasilinear' single-cell data analysis	2020-04-13	Scaling single-cell data exploratory analysis with the rapidly growing diversity and quantity of single-cell omics datasets demands more interpretable and robust data representation that is generalizable across datasets. To address this challenge, here we developed a novel ‘quasilinear’ framework that combines the interpretability and transferability of linear methods with the representational power of nonlinear methods. Within this framework, we introduce a data representation and visualization method, GraphDR, and a structure discovery method, StructDR, that unifies cluster, trajectory, and surface estimation and allows their confidence set inference. We applied both methods to diverse single-cell RNA-seq datasets from whole embryos and tissues. Unlike PCA and t-SNE, GraphDR and StructDR generated representations that both distinguished highly specific cell types and were comparable across datasets. In addition, GraphDR is at least an order of magnitude faster than commonly used nonlinear methods. Our visualizations of scRNA-seq data from developing zebrafish and Xenopus embryos revealed extruding branches of lineages from a continuum of cell states, suggesting that the current branch view of cell specification may be oversimplified. Moreover, StructDR identified a novel neuronal population using scRNA-seq data from mouse hippocampus.

That makes it possible to discover dosage effects invisible at tissue level, provided that the cell lineages can be accurately reconstructed.Here, we present a Minimal Event Distance Aneuploidy Lineage Tree (MEDALT) algorithm that infers the evolution history of a cell population based on single-cell copy number (SCCN) profiles. We also present a statistical routine named lineage speciation analysis (LSA), which facilitates discovery of fitness-associated alterations and genes from SCCN lineage trees.We assessed our approaches using a variety of single-cell datasets. Overall, MEDALT appeared more accurate than phylogenetics approaches in reconstructing copy number lineage. From the single-cell DNA-sequencing data of 20 triple-negative breast cancer patients, our approaches effectively prioritized genes that are essential for breast cancer cell fitness and are predictive of patient survival, including those implicating convergent evolution. Similar benefits were observed when applying our approaches on single-cell RNA sequencing data obtained from cancer patients.The source code of our study is available at https://github.com/KChen-lab/MEDALT.	531	1.4537987679671458	11	68	0	0	18

Here, we introduce SICILIAN, a new method that assigns statistical confidence to splice junctions from a spliced aligner to improve precision. SICILIAN’s precise splice detection achieves high accuracy on simulated data, improves concordance between matched single-cell and bulk datasets, increases agreement between biological replicates, and reliably detects un-annotated splicing in single cells, enabling the discovery of novel splicing regulation.	529	1.4483230663928817	3	29	6	0.011342155009451797	12.6

In order to simplify and systematize this process, we introduce UNCURL-App, an online GUI-based interactive scRNA-Seq analysis tool. UNCURL-App introduces two key innovations: First, prior knowledge in the form of cell type, anatomy, and Gene Ontology databases is integrated directly with the rest of the analysis process, allowing users to automatically map cell clusters to known cell types based on gene expression. Second, tools for interactive re-analysis allow the user to iteratively create, merge, or delete clusters in order to arrive at an optimal mapping between clusters and cell types.The website is at https://uncurl.cs.washington.edu/.

Clusters identified using unsupervised clustering are typically annotated to cell types based on differentially expressed genes. In contrast, supervised methods use a reference panel of labelled transcriptomes to guide both clustering and cell type identification. Supervised and unsupervised clustering strategies have their distinct advantages and limitations. Therefore, they can lead to different but often complementary clustering results. Hence, a consensus approach leveraging the merits of both clustering paradigms could result in a more accurate clustering and a more precise cell type annotation. We present scConsensus, an R framework for generating a consensus clustering by (i) integrating the results from both unsupervised and supervised approaches and (ii) refining the consensus clusters using differentially expressed (DE) genes. The value of our approach is demonstrated on several existing single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, including data from sorted PBMC sub-populations. scConsensus is freely available on GitHub at https://github.com/prabhakarlab/scConsensus.	520	1.4236824093086926	8	22	2	0.0038461538461538464	18.05

Understanding these interactions is crucial for studying the mechanisms in cell differentiation, growth and development. Computational methods are needed to infer these networks from measured data. Although the availability of single cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data provides unprecedented scale and resolution of gene-expression data, the inference of GRNs remains a challenge, mainly due to the complexity of the regulatory relationships and the noise in the data.We propose GRNUlar, a novel deep learning architecture based on the unrolled algorithms idea for GRN inference from scRNA-Seq data. Like some existing methods which use prior information of which genes are TFs, GRNUlar also incorporates this TF information using a sparse multi-task deep learning architecture. We also demonstrate the application of a recently developed unrolled architecture GLAD to recover undirected GRNs in the absence of TF information. These unrolled architectures require supervision to train, for which we leverage the existing synthetic data simulators which generate scRNA-Seq data guided by a GRN. We show that unrolled algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods on synthetic data as well as real datasets in both the settings of TF information being absent or available.Github link to GRNUlar - https://github.com/Harshs27/GRNUlarhshrivastava3@gatech.edu	519	1.4209445585215605	4	31	0	0	17.38

To overcome this challenge, we created DoubletDecon to identify and remove doublets, multiplets of two cells, by using a combination of deconvolution to identify putative doublets and analyses of unique gene expression. Here we provide the protocol for running DoubletDecon on scRNA-seq data.For complete details on the use of this protocol, please see DePasquale et al.

While computational methods for scRNAseq cell type clustering have advanced, the ability to integrate datasets to identify common and novel cell types across experiments remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a cluster-to-cluster cell type matching method – FR-Match – that utilizes supervised feature selection for dimensionality reduction and incorporates shared information among cells to determine whether two cell type clusters share the same underlying multivariate gene expression distribution. FR-Match is benchmarked with existing cell-to-cell and cell-to-cluster cell type matching methods using both simulated and real scRNAseq data. FR-Match proved to be a stringent method that produced fewer erroneous matches of distinct cell subtypes and had the unique ability to identify novel cell phenotypes in new datasets. In silico validation demonstrated that the proposed workflow is the only self-contained algorithm that was robust to increasing numbers of true negatives (i.e. non-represented cell types). FR-Match was applied to two human brain scRNAseq datasets sampled from cortical layer 1 and full thickness middle temporal gyrus. When mapping cell types identified in specimens isolated from these overlapping human brain regions, FR-Match precisely recapitulated the laminar characteristics of matched cell type clusters, reflecting their distinct neuroanatomical distributions. An R package and Shiny application are provided at https://github.com/JCVenterInstitute/FRmatch for users to interactively explore and match scRNAseq cell type clusters with complementary visualization tools.	511	1.3990417522245038	7	44	0	0	4.1
10.1101/2020.05.05.078550	FALSE	TRUE	Graph Drawing-based Dimensionality Reduction to Identify Hidden Communities in Single-Cell Sequencing Spatial Representation	2020-05-05	With the rapid growth of single cell sequencing technologies, finding cell communities with high accuracy has become crucial for large scale projects. Employing the current commonly used dimensionality reduction techniques such as tSNE and UMAP, it is often difficult to clearly distinguish cell communities in high dimensional space. Usually cell communities with similar origin and trajectories cluster so closely to each that their subtle but important differences do not become readily apparent. This creates a problem for clustering, as clustering is also performed on dimensionality reduction results. In order to identify such communities, scientists either perform broad clustering and then extract each cluster and perform re-clustering to identify sub-populations or they over-cluster the data and then merging the clusters with similar gene expressions. This is an incredibly cumbersome and time-consuming process. To solve this problem, we propose K-nearest-neighbor-based Network graph drawing Layout (KNetL, pronounced like ‘nettle’) for dimensionality reduction. In our method, we use force-directed graph drawing, whereby the attractive force (analogous to a spring force) and the repulsive force (analogous to an electrical force in atomic particles) between the cells are evaluated, and the cell communities are organized in a structural visualization. The coordinates of the force-compacted nodes are then extracted, and we employ dimensionality reduction methods, such as tSNE and UMAP to unpack the nodes. The final plot, a KNetL map, shows a visually-appealing and distinctive separation between cell communities. Our results show that KNetL maps bring significant resolution to visualizing and identifying otherwise hidden cell communities. All the algorithms are implemented in the iCellR package and available through the CRAN repository. Single (i) Cell R package (iCellR) provides great flexibility at every step of the analysis pipeline, including normalization, clustering, dimensionality reduction, interactive 2D and 3D visualizations, batch alignment or data integration, imputation, and interactive cell gating tools, which allow users to manually gate around the cells.	509	1.3935660506502396	2	10	1	0.0019646365422396855	2.5
10.1101/2020.05.08.083337	FALSE	TRUE	Joint probabilistic modeling of paired transcriptome and proteome measurements in single cells	2020-05-10	The paired measurement of RNA and surface protein abundance in single cells with CITE-seq is a promising approach to connect transcriptional variation with cell phenotypes and functions. However, each data modality exhibits unique technical biases, making it challenging to conduct a joint analysis and combine these two views into a unified representation of cell state. Here we present Total Variational Inference (totalVI), a framework for the joint probabilistic analysis of paired RNA and protein data from single cells. totalVI probabilistically represents the data as a composite of biological and technical factors such as limited sensitivity of the RNA data, background in the protein data, and batch effects. To evaluate totalVI, we performed CITE-seq on immune cells from murine spleen and lymph nodes with biological replicates and with different antibody panels measuring over 100 surface proteins. With this dataset, we demonstrate that totalVI provides a cohesive solution for common analysis tasks like the integration of datasets with matched or unmatched protein panels, dimensionality reduction, clustering, evaluation of correlations between molecules, and differential expression testing. totalVI enables scalable, end-to-end analysis of paired RNA and protein data from single cells and is available as open-source software.	504	1.379876796714579	7	121	6	0.011904761904761904	32.85

However, existing approaches neglect the local density of data points in the original space, often resulting in misleading visualizations where densely populated subpopulations of cells are given more visual space even if they account for only a small fraction of transcriptional diversity within the dataset. We present den-SNE and densMAP, our density-preserving visualization tools based on t-SNE and UMAP, respectively, and demonstrate their ability to facilitate more accurate visual interpretation of single-cell RNA-seq data. On recently published datasets, our methods newly reveal significant changes in transcriptomic variability within a range of biological processes, including cancer, immune cell specialization in human, and the developmental trajectory ofC. elegans. Our methods are readily applicable to visualizing high-dimensional data in other scientific domains.	500	1.3689253935660506	3	41	1	0.002	78.08
10.1101/2020.05.13.093765	FALSE	TRUE	DCI: Learning Causal Differences between Gene Regulatory Networks	2020-05-15	Designing interventions to control gene regulation necessitates modeling a gene regulatory network by a causal graph. Currently, large-scale expression datasets from different conditions, cell types, disease states and developmental time points are being collected. However, application of classical causal inference algorithms to infer gene regulatory networks based on such data is still challenging, requiring high sample sizes and computational resources. Here, we propose an algorithm that efficiently learns the differences in gene regulatory mechanisms between different conditions. Our difference causal inference (DCI) algorithm infers changes (i.e., edges that appeared, disappeared or changed weight) between two causal graphs given gene expression data from the two conditions. This algorithm is efficient in its use of samples and computation since it infers the differences between causal graphs directly without estimating each possibly large causal graph separately. We provide a user-friendly Python implementation of DCI and also enable the user to learn the most robust difference causal graph across different tuning parameters via stability selection. Finally, we show how to apply DCI to bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data from different conditions and cell states, and we also validate our algorithm by predicting the effects of interventions.All algorithms are freely available as a Python package at http://uhlerlab.github.io/causaldag/dcicuhler@mit.edu	499	1.3661875427789185	3	31	1	0.002004008016032064	12.43

A number of alignment methods have been developed to enable the integration and comparison of scRNA-Seq data from such studies. While each performs well on some of the datasets, to date no method was able to both perform the alignment using the original expression space and generalize to new data. To enable such analysis we developed Single Cell Iterative Point set Registration (SCIPR) which extends methods that were successfully applied to align image data to scRNA-Seq. We discuss the required changes needed, the resulting optimization function, and algorithms for learning a transformation function for aligning data. We tested SCIPR on several scRNA-Seq datasets. As we show it successfully aligns data from several different cell types, improving upon prior methods proposed for this task. In addition, we show the parameters learned by SCIPR can be used to align data not used in the training and to identify key cell type-specific genes.Integrating single cell expression data (scRNA-Seq) across labs, platforms, and technologies is a major challenge. Current methods for addressing this problem attempt to align cells in one study to match cells in another. While successful, current methods are unable to learn a general alignment in gene space that can be used to process new or additional data not used in the learning. Here we show that the scRNA-Seq alignment problem resembles a well known problem in the field of computer vision and robotics: point-cloud registration. We next extend traditional iterative rigid-object alignment methods for scRNA-seq while satisfying a set of unique constraints that distinguishes our solution from past methods. Analysis of transcriptomics data demonstrates that our method can accurately align scRNA-seq data, can generalize to unseen datasets, and can provide useful insights about genes active in the cells being studied.	501	1.3716632443531827	2	35	0	0	9.08

In most analysis protocols, single-cell type annotation relies on marker genes or RNA-seq profiles, resulting in poor extrapolation. Here, we introduce scDeepSort (https://github.com/ZJUFanLab/scDeepSort), a reference-free cell-type annotation tool for single-cell transcriptomics that uses a deep learning model with a weighted graph neural network. Using human and mouse scRNA-seq data resources, we demonstrate the feasibility of scDeepSort and its high accuracy in labeling 764,741 cells involving 56 human and 32 mouse tissues. Significantly, scDeepSort outperformed reference-dependent methods in annotating 76 external testing scRNA-seq datasets, including 126,384 cells (85.79%) from ten human tissues and 134,604 cells from 12 mouse tissues (81.30%). scDeepSort accurately revealed cell identities without prior reference knowledge, thus potentially providing new insights into mechanisms underlying biological processes, disease pathogenesis, and disease progression at a single-cell resolution.	500	1.3689253935660506	10	31	1	0.002	16.78

Here, we developed a novel deep learning algorithm to overcome batch effects using batch-aware triplet neural networks, called INSCT (“Insight”). Using simulated and real data, we demonstrate that INSCT generates an embedding space which accurately integrates cells across experiments, platforms and species. Our benchmark comparisons with current state-of-the-art scRNA-seq integration methods revealed that INSCT outperforms competing methods in scalability while achieving comparable accuracies. Moreover, using INSCT in semi-supervised mode enables users to classify unlabeled cells by projecting them into a reference collection of annotated cells. To demonstrate scalability, we applied INSCT to integrate more than 2.6 million transcriptomes from four independent studies of mouse brains in less than 1.5 hours using less than 25 gigabytes of memory. This feature empowers researchers to perform atlasing scale data integration in a typical desktop computer environment.

Thus, joint analysis of atlas datasets requires reliable data integration.Choosing a data integration method is a challenge due to the difficulty of defining integration success. Here, we benchmark 38 method and preprocessing combinations on 77 batches of gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and simulation data from 23 publications, altogether representing &gt;1.2 million cells distributed in nine atlas-level integration tasks. Our integration tasks span several common sources of variation such as individuals, species, and experimental labs. We evaluate methods according to scalability, usability, and their ability to remove batch effects while retaining biological variation.Using 14 evaluation metrics, we find that highly variable gene selection improves the performance of data integration methods, whereas scaling pushes methods to prioritize batch removal over conservation of biological variation. Overall, BBKNN, Scanorama, and scVI perform well, particularly on complex integration tasks; Seurat v3 performs well on simpler tasks with distinct biological signals; and methods that prioritize batch removal perform best for ATAC-seq data integration. Our freely available reproducible python module can be used to identify optimal data integration methods for new data, benchmark new methods, and improve method development.	491	1.3442847364818618	11	67	47	0.09572301425661914	206.13

With increasingly large scRNAseq datasets, unsupervised clustering methods can now produce detailed catalogues of transcriptionally distinct groups of cells in a sample. However, the interpretation of these clusters is challenging for both technical and biological reasons. Popular clustering algorithms are sensitive to parameter choices, and can produce different clustering solutions with even small changes in the number of principal components used, the k nearest neighbor, and the resolution parameters, among others.Here, we present a set of tools to evaluate cluster stability by subsampling, which can guide parameter choice and aid in biological interpretation. The R package scclusteval and the accompanying Snakemake workflow implement all steps of the pipeline: subsampling the cells, repeating the clustering with Seurat, and estimation of cluster stability using the Jaccard similarity index. The Snakemake workflow takes advantage of high-performance computing clusters and dispatches jobs in parallel to available CPUs to speed up the analysis.

Although scRNAseq has some technical challenges, it would be of great interest being able to disclose biological information out of cell subpopulations, which can be defined by cluster analysis of scRNAseq data. In this manuscript, we evaluated the efficacy of sparsely-connected autoencoder (SCA) as tool for the functional mining of single cells clusters. We show that SCA can be uses as tool to uncover hidden features associated to scRNAseq data. Our approach is strengthened by two metrics, QCF and QCM, which respectively allow to evaluate the ability of SCA to reconstruct a cells cluster and to evaluate the overall quality of the neural network model. Our data indicate that SCA encoded spaces, derived by different experimentally validated data (TFs targets, miRNAs targets, Kinases targets, and cancer-related immune signatures), can be used to grasp single cell cluster-specific functional features. In our implementation, SCA efficacy comes from its ability to reconstruct only specific clusters, thus indicating only those clusters where the SCA encoding space is a key element for cells aggregation. SCA analysis is implemented as module in rCASC framework and it is supported by a GUI to simplify it usage for biologists and medical personnel.	484	1.325119780971937	9	42	0	0	12.08

One of the most common analyses of scRNA-seq data detects distinct subpopulations of cells through the use of unsupervised clustering algorithms. However, recent advances in scRNA-seq technologies result in current datasets ranging from thousands to millions of cells. Popular clustering algorithms, such as k-means, typically require the data to be loaded entirely into memory and therefore can be slow or impossible to run with large datasets. To address this problem, we developed the mbkmeans R/Bioconductor package, an open-source implementation of the mini-batch k-means algorithm. Our package allows for on-disk data representations, such as the common HDF5 file format widely used for single-cell data, that do not require all the data to be loaded into memory at one time. We demonstrate the performance of the mbkmeans package using large datasets, including one with 1.3 million cells. We also highlight and compare the computing performance of mbkmeans against the standard implementation of k - means.

This has mainly been investigated for imaging data but could also be useful for single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq). A small pilot study could be used for planning a full-scale study by investigating planned analysis strategies on synthetic data with different sample sizes. It is unclear whether synthetic observations generated based on a small scRNA-seq dataset reflect the properties relevant for subsequent data analysis steps.We specifically investigated two deep generative modeling approaches, VAEs and DBMs. First, we considered single-cell variational inference (scVI) in two variants, generating samples from the posterior distribution, the standard approach, or the prior distribution. Second, we propose single-cell deep Boltzmann machines (scDBM). When considering the similarity of clustering results on synthetic data to ground-truth clustering, we find that the scVIposterior variant resulted in high variability, most likely due to amplifying artifacts of small data sets. All approaches showed mixed results for cell types with different abundance by overrepresenting highly abundant cell types and missing less abundant cell types. With increasing pilot dataset sizes, the proportions of the cells in each cluster became more similar to that of ground-truth data. We also showed that all approaches learn the univariate distribution of most genes, but problems occurred with bimodality. Overall, the results showed that generative deep learning approaches might be valuable for supporting the design of scRNA-seq experiments.	486	1.3305954825462012	6	41	0	0	12.33

Measured single-cell transcriptomes are grouped by similarity and the resulting clusters are mapped to cell types based on cluster-specific gene expression patterns. While the process of generating clusters has become largely automated, annotation remains a laborious ad-hoc effort that requires expert biological knowledge. Here, we introduce CellMeSH - a new automated approach to identifying cell types based on prior literature. CellMeSH combines a database of gene-cell type associations with a probabilistic method for database querying. The database is constructed by automatically linking gene and cell type information from millions of publications using existing indexed literature resources. Compared to manually constructed databases, CellMeSH is more comprehensive and scales automatically. The probabilistic query method enables reliable information retrieval even though the gene-cell type associations extracted from the literature are necessarily noisy. CellMeSH achieves up to 60% top-1 accuracy and 90% top-3 accuracy in annotating the cell types on a human dataset, and up to 58.8% top-1 accuracy and 88.2% top-3 accuracy on three mouse datasets, which is consistently better than existing approaches.Web server: https://uncurl.cs.washington.edu/db_query and API: https://github.com/shunfumao/cellmesh	483	1.322381930184805	4	70	0	0	2.25
10.1101/2020.06.02.129031	FALSE	TRUE	FIRM: Fast Integration of single-cell RNA-sequencing data across Multiple platforms	2020-06-03	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is being used extensively to measure the mRNA expression of individual cells from deconstructed tissues, organs, and even entire organisms to generate cell atlas references, leading to discoveries of novel cell types and deeper insight into biological trajectories. These massive datasets are usually collected from many samples using different scRNA-seq technology platforms, including the popular SMART-Seq2 (SS2) and 10X platforms. Inherent heterogeneities between platforms, tissues, and other batch effects makes scRNA-seq data difficult to compare and integrate, especially in large-scale cell atlas efforts; yet, accurate integration is essential for gaining deeper insights into cell biology. Through comprehensive data exploration, we found that accurate integration is often hampered by differences in cell-type compositions. Herein we describe FIRM, an algorithm that addresses this problem and achieves efficient and accurate integration of heterogeneous scRNA-seq datasets across multiple tissue types, platforms, and experimental batches. We applied FIRM to numerous large-scale scRNA-seq datasets from mouse, mouse lemur, and human, comparing its performance in dataset integration with other state-of-the-art methods. FIRM-integrated datasets show accurate mixing of shared cell type identities and superior preservation of original structure without overcorrection, generating robust integrated datasets for downstream exploration and analysis. It is also a facile way to transfer cell type labels and annotations from one dataset to another, making it a reliable and versatile tool for scRNA-seq analysis, especially for cell atlas data integration.	480	1.3141683778234086	6	24	0	0	14.83

Here, we present scNym, a semi-supervised, adversarial neural network that learns to transfer cell identity annotations from one experiment to another. scNym takes advantage of information in both labeled datasets and new, unlabeled datasets to learn rich representations of cell identity that enable effective annotation transfer. We show that scNym effectively transfers annotations across experiments despite biological and technical differences, achieving performance superior to existing methods. We also show that scNym models can synthesize information from multiple training and target datasets to improve performance. In addition to high performance, we show that scNym models are well-calibrated and interpretable with saliency methods.	478	1.3086926762491444	2	42	4	0.008368200836820083	47.73

In the case of T cells, these technologies have made it possible to profile clonotype, defined by T cell receptor (TCR) sequence, and phenotype, as reflected in gene expression (GEX) profile, surface protein expression, and peptide:MHC (pMHC) binding, across large and diverse cell populations. These rich, high-dimensional datasets have the potential to reveal new relationships between TCR sequence and T cell phenotype that go beyond identification of features shared by clonally related cells. In order to uncover these connections in an unbiased way, we developed a graph-theoretic approach---clonotype neighbor-graph analysis or “CoNGA”---that identifies correlations between GEX profile and TCR sequence through statistical analysis of a pair of T cell similarity graphs, one in which cells are linked based on gene expression similarity and another in which cells are linked by similarity of TCR sequence. Applying CoNGA across diverse human and mouse T cell datasets uncovered known and novel associations between TCR sequence features and cellular phenotype including the classical invariant T cell subsets; a novel defined population of human blood CD8+ T cells expressing the transcription factors HOBIT and HELIOS, NK-associated receptors, and a biased TCR repertoire, representing a potential previously undescribed lineage of “natural lymphocytes”; a striking association between usage of a specific V-beta gene segment and expression of the EPHB6 gene that is conserved between mouse and human; and TCR sequence determinants of differentiation in developing thymocytes. As the size and scale of single-cell datasets continue to grow, we expect that CoNGA will prove to be a useful tool for deconvolving complex relationships between TCR sequence and cellular state in single-cell applications.	478	1.3086926762491444	8	46	6	0.012552301255230125	39.5
10.1101/2020.06.05.134452	FALSE	TRUE	CACTUS: integrating clonal architecture with genomic clustering and transcriptome profiling of single tumor cells	2020-06-06	Drawing genotype-to-phenotype maps in tumors is of paramount importance for understanding tumor heterogeneity. Assignment of single cells to their tumor clones of origin can be approached by matching the genotypes of the clones to the mutations found in RNA sequencing of the cells. The confidence of the cell-to-clone mapping can be increased by accounting for additional measurements. Follicular lymphoma, a malignancy of mature B cells that continuously acquire mutations in parallel in the exome and in B-cell receptor loci, presents a unique opportunity to align exome-derived mutations with B-cell receptor clonotypes as an independent measure for clonal evolution.Here, we propose CACTUS, a probabilistic model that leverages the information from an independent genomic clustering of cells and exploits the scarce single cell RNA sequencing data to map single cells to given imperfect genotypes of tumor clones. We apply CACTUS to two follicular lymphoma patient samples, integrating three measurements: whole exome sequencing, single cell RNA sequencing, and B-cell receptor sequencing. CACTUS outperforms a predecessor model by confidently assigning cells and B-cell receptor clonotypes to the tumor clones.The integration of independent measurements increases model certainty and is the key to improving model performance in the challenging task of charting the genotype-to-phenotype maps in tumors. CACTUS opens the avenue to study the functional implications of tumor heterogeneity, and origins of resistance to targeted therapies.	477	1.3059548254620124	11	35	0	0	6.45

On one hand, the data produced by scRNASeq is technically complex, with analytical workflows that are still very much an active field of bioinformatics research, and on the other hand, a wealth of biological background knowledge is often needed to guide the investigation. Therefore, there is an increasing need to develop applications geared towards bench-scientists to help them abstract the technical challenges of the analysis, so that they can focus on the Science at play. It is also expected that such applications should support closer collaboration between bioinformaticians and bench-scientists by providing reproducible science tools.We present SCHNAPPs, a computer program designed to enable bench-scientists to autonomously explore and interpret single cell RNA-seq expression data and associated annotations. The Shiny-based application allows selecting genes and cells of interest, performing quality control, normalization, clustering, and differential expression analyses, applying standard workflows from Seurat (Stuart et al., 2019) or Scran (Lun et al., 2016) packages, and most of the common visualizations. An R-markdown report can be generated that tracks the modifications, and selected visualizations facilitating communication and reproducibility between bench-scientist and bioinformatician. The modular design of the tool allows to easily integrate new visualizations and analyses by bioinformaticians. We still recommend that a data analysis specialist oversees the analysis and interpretation.The SCHNAPPs application, docker file, and documentation are available on GitHub: https://c3bi-pasteur-fr.github.io/UTechSCB-SCHNAPPs; Example contribution are available at the following GitHub site: https://github.com/baj12/SCHNAPPsContributions.	474	1.297741273100616	4	25	0	0	5.3

The dimension reduction and clustering for identification of cell types from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data have become foundational approaches to HCA. The major challenges of current computational analyses are of poor performance on large scale data and sensitive to initial data. We present a new ensemble framework called Adaptive Slice KNNs (scASK) to address the challenges for analysing scRNA-seq data with high dimensionality. scASK consists of three innovational modules, called DAS (Data Adaptive Slicing), MCS (Meta Classifiers Selecting) and EMS (Ensemble Mode Switching), respectively, which facilitate scASK to approximate a bias-variance tradeoff beyond classification. Thirteen real scRNA-seq datasets are used to evaluate the performance of scASK. Compared with five popular classification algorithms, our experimental results indicate that scASK achieves the best accuracy and robustness among all competing methods. In conclusion, adaptive slicing is an effective structural reduction procedure, and meanwhile scASK provides novel and robust ensemble framework especially for classifying cell types based on scRNA-seq data. scASK is publically available at https://github.com/liubo2358/scASKcmd.	475	1.3004791238877482	3	44	0	0	8.58

However, the noisy and high-dimensional nature of the generated data poses significant challenges for its analysis and integration. Here, I describe Monet, an open-source Python package designed to provide effective and computationally efficient solutions to some of the most common challenges encountered in scRNA-Seq data analysis, and to serve as a toolkit for scRNA-Seq method development. At its core, Monet implements algorithms to infer the dimensionality and construct a PCA-based latent space from a given dataset. This latent space, represented by a MonetModel object, then forms the basis for data analysis and integration. In addition to validating these core algorithms, I provide demonstrations of some more advanced analysis tasks currently supported, such as batch correction and label transfer, which are useful for analyzing multiple datasets from the same tissue. Monet is available at https://github.com/flo-compbio/monet. Ongoing work is focused on providing electronic notebooks with tutorials for individual analysis tasks, and on developing interoperability with other Python scRNA-Seq software.

10.1101/2020.06.11.146845	FALSE	TRUE	SCIM: Universal Single-Cell Matching with Unpaired Feature Sets	2020-06-12	Recent technological advances have led to an increase in the production and availability of single-cell data. The ability to integrate a set of multi-technology measurements would allow the identification of biologically or clinically meaningful observations through the unification of the perspectives afforded by each technology. In most cases, however, profiling technologies consume the used cells and thus pairwise correspondences between datasets are lost. Due to the sheer size single-cell datasets can acquire, scalable algorithms that are able to universally match single-cell measurements carried out in one cell to its corresponding sibling in another technology are needed.We propose Single-Cell data Integration via Matching (SCIM), a scalable approach to recover such correspondences in two or more technologies. SCIM assumes that cells share a common (low-dimensional) underlying structure and that the underlying cell distribution is approximately constant across technologies. It constructs a technology-invariant latent space using an auto-encoder framework with an adversarial objective. Multi-modal datasets are integrated by pairing cells across technologies using a bipartite matching scheme that operates on the low-dimensional latent representations. We evaluate SCIM on a simulated cellular branching process and show that the cell-to-cell matches derived by SCIM reflect the same pseudotime on the simulated dataset. Moreover, we apply our method to two real-world scenarios, a melanoma tumor sample and a human bone marrow sample, where we pair cells from a scRNA dataset to their sibling cells in a CyTOF dataset achieving 93% and 84% cell-matching accuracy for each one of the samples respectively.https://github.com/ratschlab/scim	471	1.2895277207392197	9	43	1	0.0021231422505307855	32.88
10.1101/2020.06.15.151910	FALSE	TRUE	Linear-time cluster ensembles of large-scale single-cell RNA-seq and multimodal data	2020-06-15	A fundamental task in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis is the identification of transcriptionally distinct groups of cells. Numerous methods have been proposed for this problem, with a recent focus on methods for the cluster analysis of ultra-large scRNA-seq data sets produced by droplet-based sequencing technologies. Most existing methods rely on a sampling step to bridge the gap between algorithm scalability and volume of the data. Ignoring large parts of the data, however, often yields inaccurate groupings of cells and risks overlooking rare cell types. We propose method Specter that adopts and extends recent algorithmic advances in (fast) spectral clustering. In contrast to methods that cluster a (random) subsample of the data, we adopt the idea of landmarks that are used to create a sparse representation of the full data from which a spectral embedding can then be computed in linear time. We exploit Specter’s speed in a cluster ensemble scheme that achieves a substantial improvement in accuracy over existing methods and that is sensitive to rare cell types. Its linear time complexity allows Specter to scale to millions of cells and leads to fast computation times in practice. Furthermore, on CITE-seq data that simultaneously measures gene and protein marker expression we demonstrate that Specter is able to utilize multimodal omics measurements to resolve subtle transcriptomic differences between subpopulations of cells.

However, they have inherent limitations when applied to heterogeneous sets of data with moderate overlap in cell states or sub-types. STACAS is a package for the identification of integration anchors in the Seurat environment, optimized for the integration of datasets that share only a subset of cell types. We demonstrate that by i) correcting batch effects while preserving relevant biological variability across datasets, ii) filtering aberrant integration anchors with a quantitative distance measure, and iii) constructing optimal guide trees for integration, STACAS can accurately align scRNA-seq datasets composed of only partially overlapping cell populations. We anticipate that the algorithm will be a useful tool for the construction of comprehensive single-cell atlases by integration of the growing amount of single-cell data becoming available in public repositories.R package:https://github.com/carmonalab/STACASDocker image:https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mandrea1/stacas_demo	468	1.2813141683778233	2	10	1	0.002136752136752137	24.93

However, there lacks a direct approach to infer clinical information in single-cell data to prioritize cells with respect to disease status or patient outcomes. We propose DEGAS (Diagnostic Evidence GAuge of Single cells), a novel deep learning and transfer learning framework, to transfer prognostic information from patients to cells. We call such transferrable information “impressions,” which allow individual cells to be associated with disease outcomes. Using simulated data as well as nine diverse single cell and patient bulk tissue transcriptomic datasets from Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), and Multiple Myeloma (MM), we demonstrate the feasibility, flexibility, and broad applications of the DEGAS framework. The analysis on MM led to the identification of a PHF19high myeloma cell subtype associated with myeloma progression. DEGAS is freely available as an R package.By leveraging preexisting patient cohorts, DEGAS provides novel tools to identify high-risk cells in complex diseases at single cell resolution.	467	1.2785763175906912	16	58	0	0	1.5

The most common application of RNA Sequencing is Differential Expression analysis and it is used to determine genetic loci with distinct expression across different conditions. On the other hand, an emerging field called single-cell RNA sequencing is used for transcriptome profiling at the individual cell level. The standard protocols for both these types of analyses include the processing of sequencing libraries and result in the generation of count matrices. An obstacle to these analyses and the acquisition of meaningful results is that both require programming expertise.BingleSeq was developed as an intuitive application that provides a user-friendly solution for the analysis of count matrices produced by both Bulk and Single-cell RNA-Seq experiments. This was achieved by building an interactive dashboard-like user interface and incorporating three state-of-the-art software packages for each type of the aforementioned analyses, alongside additional features such as key visualisation techniques, functional gene annotation analysis and rank-based consensus for differential gene analysis results, among others. As a result, BingleSeq puts the best and most widely used packages and tools for RNA-Seq analyses at the fingertips of biologists with no programming experience.	467	1.2785763175906912	2	47	0	0	8.2

For instance, when clustering single-cell transcriptomes, is the analysis tuned to discover broad or specific cell types? Likewise, protein communities revealed from protein networks can vary widely in sizes depending on the method. Here we use the concept of “persistent homology”, drawn from mathematical topology, to identify robust structures in data at all scales simultaneously.

However, robust reference atlases that can be used to systematically interpret cellular states across studies and diseases are currently lacking. Here, we generated the first cross-study T cell atlases for cancer and viral infection and developed a novel algorithm, ProjecTILs, that enables the projection of new scRNA-seq data onto these reference atlases. ProjecTILs accurately predicted the effects of multiple perturbations, including the ablation of immunoregulatory targets controlling T cell differentiation, such as Tox, Ptpn2, miR-155 and Regnase-1, and suggested novel gene programs that were altered in these cells. Moving beyond mouse models, we used ProjecTILs to conduct a meta-analysis of human tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs), revealing a remarkable conservation of TIL subtypes between human and mouse and across cancer types. Clonotype analysis supported a model in which rare human tumor-specific effector-memory (EM)-like CD8 TILs that resemble blood-circulating EM cells, differentiate into proliferative terminal exhausted/dysfunctional effector TILs through a progenitor subtype that upregulates the exhaustion master regulator TOX. Our novel computational method allows exploring the effect of human and murine T cell perturbations (e.g. as the result of therapy or genetic engineering) in terms of reference cellular states, altered genetic programs and clonotype structure, revealing mechanisms of action behind immunotherapies and opening opportunities for their improvement.	459	1.2566735112936345	6	63	3	0.006535947712418301	66.8
10.1101/2020.06.26.173179	FALSE	TRUE	Inferring cellular trajectories from scRNA-seq using Pseudocell Tracer	2020-06-27	Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be used to infer a temporal ordering of dynamic cellular states. Current methods for the inference of cellular trajectories rely on unbiased dimensionality reduction techniques. However, such biologically agnostic ordering can prove difficult for modeling complex developmental or differentiation processes. The cellular heterogeneity of dynamic biological compartments can result in sparse sampling of key intermediate cell states. This scenario is especially pronounced in dynamic immune responses of innate and adaptive immune cells. To overcome these limitations, we develop a supervised machine learning framework, called Pseudocell Tracer, which infers trajectories in pseudospace rather than in pseudotime. The method uses a supervised encoder, trained with adjacent biological information, to project scRNA-seq data into a low-dimensional cellular state space. Then a generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to simulate pesudocells at regular intervals along a virtual cell-state axis. We demonstrate the utility of Pseudocell Tracer by modeling B cells undergoing immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) during a prototypic antigen-induced antibody response. Our results reveal an ordering of key transcription factors regulating CSR, including the concomitant induction of Nfkb1 and Stat6 prior to the upregulation of Bach2 expression. Furthermore, the expression dynamics of genes encoding cytokine receptors point to the existence of a regulatory mechanism that reinforces IL-4 signaling to direct CSR to the IgG1 isotype.	456	1.2484599589322383	6	40	0	0	9.08

The definition of the properties of single cells is the primary endpoint of such analysis, cells are typically clustered to underpin the common determinants that can be used to describe functional properties of the cell mixture under investigation. Several approaches have been proposed to identify cell clusters; while this is matter of active research, one popular approach is based on community detection in neighbourhood graphs by optimisation of modularity. In this paper we propose an alternative and principled solution to this problem, based on Stochastic Block Models. We show that such approach not only is suitable for identification of cell groups, it also provides a solid framework to perform other relevant tasks in single cell analysis, such as label transfer. To encourage the use of Stochastic Block Models, we developed a python library, schist, that is compatible with the popular scanpy framework.	454	1.242984257357974	3	58	0	0	17.38

A suitable visualization has to be intuitive and accessible. Web-based dashboards have become popular tools for the arrangement, consolidation and display of such visualizations. However, the combination of automated data processing pipelines handling omics data and dynamically generated, interactive dashboards is poorly solved. Here, we present i2dash, an R package intended to encapsulate functionality for programmatic creation of customized dashboards. It supports interactive and responsive (linked) visualizations across a set of predefined graphical layouts. i2dash addresses the needs of data analysts for a tool that is compatible and attachable to any R-based analysis pipeline, thereby fostering the separation of data visualization on one hand and data analysis tasks on the other hand. In addition, the generic design of i2dash enables data analysts to generate modular extensions for specific needs. As a proof of principle, we provide an extension of i2dash optimized for single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis, supporting the creation of dashboards for the visualization needs of single-cell sequencing experiments. Equipped with these features, i2dash is suitable for extensive use in large scale sequencing/bioinformatics facilities. Along this line, we provide i2dash as a containerized solution, enabling a straightforward large-scale deployment and sharing of dashboards using cloud services.i2dash is freely available via the R package archive CRAN.	447	1.2238193018480492	5	0	0	0	5.8

Most methods normalize data using the whole transcriptome based on the assumption that the majority of transcriptome remains constant and are unable to detect drastic changes of the transcriptome. Here, we develop an algorithm based on a small fraction of constantly expressed genes as internal spike-ins to normalize single cell RNA sequencing data. We demonstrate that the transcriptome of single cells may undergo drastic changes in several case study datasets and accounting for such heterogeneity by ISnorm improves the performance of downstream analyzes.	441	1.2073921971252566	6	37	0	0	9.346

Thus, tools to analyze this data need to evolve as well to improve accuracy and efficiency. We present FEATS, a python software package that performs clustering on single-cell RNA-seq data. FEATS is capable of performing multiple tasks such as estimating the number of clusters, conducting outlier detection, and integrating data from various experiments. We develop a univariate feature selection based approach for clustering, which involves the selection of top informative features to improve clustering performance. This is motivated by the fact that cell types are often manually determined using the expression of only a few known marker genes. On a variety of single-cell RNA-seq datasets, FEATS gives superior performance compared to the current tools, in terms of adjusted rand index (ARI) and estimating the number of clusters. In addition to cluster estimation, FEATS also performs outlier detection and data integration while giving an excellent computational performance. Thus, FEATS is a comprehensive clustering tool capable of addressing the challenges during the clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data.

Yet, learning from reference data is complicated by batch effects between datasets, limited availability of computational resources, and sharing restrictions on raw data. Leveraging advances in machine learning, we propose a deep learning strategy to map query datasets on top of a reference called single-cell architectural surgery (scArches, https://github.com/theislab/scarches). It uses transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient, decentralized, iterative reference building, and the contextualization of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data. Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, and whole organism atlases, we showcase that scArches preserves nuanced biological state information while removing batch effects in the data, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters compared to de novo integration. To demonstrate mapping disease variation, we show that scArches preserves detailed COVID-19 disease variation upon reference mapping, enabling discovery of new cell identities that are unseen during training. We envision our method to facilitate collaborative projects by enabling the iterative construction, updating, sharing, and efficient use of reference atlases.	437	1.1964407939767283	8	67	22	0.05034324942791762	111.68
10.1101/2020.07.17.207993	FALSE	TRUE	VAE-SNE: a deep generative model for simultaneous dimensionality reduction and clustering	2020-07-17	Scientific datasets are growing rapidly in scale and complexity. Consequently, the task of understanding these data to answer scientific questions increasingly requires the use of compression algorithms that reduce dimensionality by combining correlated features and cluster similar observations to summarize large datasets. Here we introduce a method for both dimension reduction and clustering called VAE-SNE (variational autoencoder stochastic neighbor embedding). Our model combines elements from deep learning, probabilistic inference, and manifold learning to produce interpretable compressed representations while also readily scaling to tens-of-millions of observations. Unlike existing methods, VAE-SNE simultaneously compresses high-dimensional data and automatically learns a distribution of clusters within the data — without the need to manually select the number of clusters. This naturally creates a multi-scale representation, which makes it straightforward to generate coarse-grained descriptions for large subsets of related observations and select specific regions of interest for further analysis. VAE-SNE can also quickly and easily embed new samples, detect outliers, and can be optimized with small batches of data, which makes it possible to compress datasets that are otherwise too large to fit into memory. We evaluate VAE-SNE as a general purpose method for dimensionality reduction by applying it to multiple real-world datasets and by comparing its performance with existing methods for dimensionality reduction. We find that VAE-SNE produces high-quality compressed representations with results that are on par with existing nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms. As a practical example, we demonstrate how the cluster distribution learned by VAE-SNE can be used for unsupervised action recognition to detect and classify repeated motifs of stereotyped behavior in high-dimensional timeseries data. Finally, we also introduce variants of VAE-SNE for embedding data in polar (spherical) coordinates and for embedding image data from raw pixels. VAE-SNE is a robust, feature-rich, and scalable method with broad applicability to a range of datasets in the life sciences and beyond.	436	1.1937029431895962	2	147	5	0.011467889908256881	131.1

The amount of scRNA-seq data is growing extremely fast, and novel algorithmic approaches improving these steps are key to extract more biological information. Here, we introduce: (i) two methods for automatic cell type identification (i.e. without expert curator) based on a voting algorithm and a Hopfield classifier, (ii) a method for cell anomaly quantification based on isolation forest, and (iii) a tool for the visualization of cell phenotypic landscapes based on Hopfield energy-like functions. These new approaches are integrated in a software platform that includes many other state-of-the-art methodologies and provides a self-contained toolkit for scRNA-seq analysis.We present a suite of software elements for the analysis of scRNA-seq data. This Python-based open source software, Digital Cell Sorter (DCS), consists in an extensive toolkit of methods for scRNA-seq analysis. We illustrate the capability of the software using data from large datasets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as well as plasma cells of bone marrow samples from healthy donors and multiple myeloma patients. We test the novel algorithms by evaluating their ability to deconvolve cell mixtures and detect small numbers of anomalous cells in PBMC data.The DCS toolkit is available for download and installation through the Python Package Index (PyPI). The software can be deployed using the Python import function following installation.

10.1101/2020.07.21.214387	FALSE	TRUE	Inference and analysis of cell-cell communication using CellChat	2020-07-22	Understanding global communications among cells requires accurate representation of cell-cell signaling links and effective systems-level analyses of those links. We constructed a database of interactions among ligands, receptors and their cofactors that accurately represents known heteromeric molecular complexes. Based on mass action models, we then developed CellChat, a tool that is able to quantitively infer and analyze intercellular communication networks from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. CellChat predicts major signaling inputs and outputs for cells and how those cells and signals coordinate for functions using network analysis and pattern recognition approaches. Through manifold learning and quantitative contrasts, CellChat classifies signaling pathways and delineates conserved and context-specific pathways across different datasets. Applications of CellChat to several mouse skin scRNA-seq datasets for embryonic development and adult wound healing shows its ability to extract complex signaling patterns, both previously known as well as novel. Our versatile and easy-to-use toolkit CellChat and a web-based Explorer (http://www.cellchat.org/) will help discover novel intercellular communications and build a cell-cell communication atlas in diverse tissues.	431	1.1800136892539357	7	76	18	0.04176334106728538	2.25
10.1101/2020.07.22.216002	FALSE	TRUE	Single-cell classification using learned cell phenotypes	2020-07-24	Single-cell methods such as flow cytometry, Mass cytometry and single-cell mRNA sequencing collect high-dimensional data on thousands to millions of individual cells. An important aim during the analysis of such data is to classify cells into known categories and cell types. One commonly used approach towards this is clustering of cells with similar features followed by manual annotation of clusters in relation to known biology. A second approach, commonly used for cytometry data relies on manual sorting or “gating” of cells, often based on pairwise combinations of measurements used in a stepwise and very tedious process of cell annotation. Both of these approaches require manual inspection and annotation of every new dataset generated, a process that is not only time consuming but also subjective and surely influential for the conclusions drawn. The manual annotation is also difficult to reproduce by other researchers with a different perception of features that signify their cells of interest. Here we propose an alternative strategy based on machine learning of known phenotypes from manually curated, high-dimensional data and thereby enabling rapid classification of subsequent datasets in a more reproducible manner. This simple approach increases both throughput, reproducibility and simplicity of cell classification in single-cell biology.	429	1.1745379876796715	4	13	3	0.006993006993006993	133.2

However, the stochasticity associated with high-throughput single-cell sequencing has made it necessary to use clustering-based computational approaches in which the characterization of cell-type heterogeneity is performed at cell-subpopulation level rather than at full single-cell resolution. We present here Cell-ID, a clustering-free multivariate statistical method for the robust extraction of per-cell gene signatures from single-cell sequencing data. Cell-ID signatures allow unbiased cell identity recognition across different donors, tissues-of-origin, model organisms and single-cell omics technologies.

Single cell-sequencing technologies are powerful tools to explore cells, however analysis is typically gene-centric and TE activity has not been addressed. Here, we developed a single-cell TE processing pipeline, scTE, and report the activity of TEs in single cells in a range of biological contexts. Specific TE types were expressed in subpopulations of embryonic stem cells and were dynamically regulated during pluripotency reprogramming, differentiation, and embryogenesis. Unexpectedly, TEs were expressed in somatic cells, including human disease-specific TEs that are undetectable in bulk analyses. Finally, we applied scTE to single cell ATAC-seq data, and demonstrate that scTE can discriminate cell type using chromatin accessibly of TEs alone. Overall, our results reveal the dynamic patterns of TEs in single cells and their contributions to cell fate and heterogeneity.	429	1.1745379876796715	11	86	2	0.004662004662004662	12.65

New technologies, such as single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), are enabling characterization of the biomaterial response to an unprecedented level of detail, facilitating new discoveries in the complex cellular environment surrounding materials. We performed scRNAseq and integrated data sets from multiple experiments to create a single cell atlas of the biomaterials response that contains 42,156 cells from biological extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived and synthetic polyester (polycaprolactone, PCL) scaffold biomaterials implanted in murine muscle wounds. We identified 18 clusters of cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, multiple subsets of fibroblasts, and myeloid cells, many of which were previously unknown in the biomaterial response. To determine intra and intercellular signaling occurring between the numerous cell subsets, including immune-stromal interactions in the biomaterial response, we developed Domino (github.com/chris-cherry/domino), a computational tool which allows for identification of condition specific intercellular signaling patterns connected to transcription factor activation from single cell data. The Domino networks self-assembled into signaling modules and cellular subsets involved in signaling independent of clustering, defining interactions between immune, fibroblast, and tissue-specific modules with biomaterials-specific communication patterns. Further compilation and integration of biomaterials single cell data sets will delineate the impact of materials chemical and physical properties and biological factors, such as anatomical placement, age, or systemic disease, that will direct biomaterials design.	428	1.1718001368925393	8	50	2	0.004672897196261682	21.33
10.1101/2020.07.29.227207	FALSE	TRUE	Non-parametric modelling of temporal and spatial counts data from RNA-seq experiments	2020-07-30	The negative binomial distribution has been shown to be a good model for counts data from both bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a useful non-parametric approach for modeling temporal or spatial changes in gene expression. However, currently available GP regression methods that implement negative binomial likelihood models do not scale to the increasingly large datasets being produced by single-cell and spatial transcriptomics.The GPcounts package implements GP regression methods for modelling counts data using a negative binomial likelihood function. Computational efficiency is achieved through the use of variational Bayesian inference. The GP function models changes in the mean of the negative binomial likelihood through a logarithmic link function and the dispersion parameter is fitted by maximum likelihood. We validate the method on simulated time course data, showing that it is better able to identify changes in over-dispersed counts data than methods based on Gaussian or Poisson likelihoods. To demonstrate temporal inference, we apply GPcounts to single-cell RNA-seq datasets after pseudotime and branching inference. To demonstrate spatial inference, we apply GPcounts to data from the mouse olfactory bulb to identify spatially variable genes and compare to two published GP methods. We also provide the option of modelling additional dropout using a zero-inflated negative binomial. Our results show that GPcounts can be used to model temporal and spatial counts data in cases where simpler Gaussian and Poisson likelihoods are unrealistic.GPcounts is implemented using the GPflow library in Python and is available at https://github.com/ManchesterBioinference/GPcounts along with the data, code and notebooks required to reproduce the results presented here.nuha.bintayyash@manchester.ac.uk or magnus.rattray@manchester.ac.uk	423	1.158110882956879	7	41	1	0.002364066193853428	46.58

As these assays have advanced in their ability to measure various aspects of molecular processes in cells, computational methods to analyze and meaningfully visualize such data have required matched innovation. Independently, Virtual Reality (VR) has recently emerged as a powerful technology to dynamically explore complex data and shows promise for adaptation to challenges in single-cell data visualization. However, adopting VR for single-cell data visualization has thus far been hindered by expensive prerequisite hardware or advanced data preprocessing skills. To address current shortcomings, we present singlecellVR, a user-friendly web application for visualizing single-cell data, designed for cheap and easily available virtual reality hardware (e.g., Google Cardboard, ∼$10). singlecellVR can visualize data from a variety of sequencing-based technologies including transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data as well as combinations thereof. Analysis modalities supported include approaches to clustering as well as trajectory inference and visualization of dynamical changes discovered through modelling RNA velocity. We provide a companion software package, scvr to streamline data conversion from the most widely-adopted single-cell analysis tools as well as a growing database of pre-analyzed datasets to which users can contribute.	423	1.158110882956879	7	42	1	0.002364066193853428	96.25
10.1101/2020.07.31.229575	FALSE	TRUE	Uncovering Transcriptional Dark Matter via Gene Annotation Independent Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis	2020-08-03	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the study of cell biology with high resolution. scRNA-seq expression analyses rely on the availability of a high quality annotation of genes in the genome. Yet, as we show here with scRNA-seq experiments and analyses spanning human, mouse, chicken, mole rat, lemur and sea urchin, gene annotations often fail to cover the full transcriptome of every cell type at every stage of development, in particular for organisms that are not routinely studied. To overcome this hurdle, we created a scRNA-seq analysis routine that recovers biologically relevant information beyond the scope of the best available gene annotation. This is achieved by performing single-cell expression analysis on any region in the genome for which transcriptional products are detected. Our routine identifies transcriptionally active regions (TARs) using a hidden Markov model, generates a matrix of expression levels for all TARs across all cells in a dataset, performs single-cell TAR expression analysis to identify TARs that are biologically significant, and then annotates biologically significant TARs using gene homology analysis. This procedure leverages single-cell expression analyses as a filter to direct annotation efforts to biologically significant transcripts in complex tissues and thereby uncovers biology to which scRNA-seq would otherwise be in the dark.	419	1.1471594798083504	8	42	0	0	26.88

We introduce the scGNN (single-cell graph neural network) to provide a hypothesis-free deep learning framework for scRNA-Seq analyses. This framework formulates and aggregates cell-cell relationships with graph neural networks and models heterogeneous gene expression patterns using a left-truncated mixture Gaussian model. scGNN integrates three iterative multi-modal autoencoders and outperforms existing tools for gene imputation and cell clustering on four benchmark scRNA-Seq datasets. In an Alzheimer’s disease study with 13,214 single nuclei from postmortem brain tissues, scGNN successfully illustrated disease-related neural development and the differential mechanism. scGNN provides an effective representation of gene expression and cell-cell relationships. It is also a novel and powerful framework that can be applied to scRNA-Seq analyses.	419	1.1471594798083504	10	51	4	0.00954653937947494	13.03
10.1101/2020.08.05.238949	FALSE	TRUE	Bayesian estimation of cell-type-specific gene expression per bulk sample with prior derived from single-cell data	2020-08-06	When assessed over a large number of samples, bulk RNA sequencing provides reliable data for gene expression at the tissue level. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) deepens those analyses by evaluating gene expression at the cellular level. Both data types lend insights into disease etiology. With current technologies, however, scRNA-seq data are known to be noisy. Moreover, constrained by costs, scRNA-seq data are typically generated from a relatively small number of subjects, which limits their utility for some analyses, such as identification of gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). To address these issues while maintaining the unique advantages of each data type, we develop a Bayesian method (bMIND) to integrate bulk and scRNA-seq data. With a prior derived from scRNA-seq data, we propose to estimate sample-level cell-type-specific (CTS) expression from bulk expression data. The CTS expression enables large-scale sample-level downstream analyses, such as detecting CTS differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and eQTLs. Through simulations, we demonstrate that bMIND improves the accuracy of sample-level CTS expression estimates and power to discover CTS-DEGs when compared to existing methods. To further our understanding of two complex phenotypes, autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer’s disease, we apply bMIND to gene expression data of relevant brain tissue to identify CTS-DEGs. Our results complement findings for CTS-DEGs obtained from snRNA-seq studies, replicating certain DEGs in specific cell types while nominating other novel genes in those cell types. Finally, we calculate CTS-eQTLs for eleven brain regions by analyzing GTEx V8 data, creating a new resource for biological insights.	416	1.1389459274469542	3	37	3	0.007211538461538462	5.35

Long-read RNA-sequencing recovers full-length transcripts but has limited throughput at the single-cell level. Here we developed single-cell full-length transcript sequencing by sampling (FLT-seq), together with the computational pipeline FLAMES to overcome these issues and perform isoform discovery and quantification, splicing analysis and mutation detection in single cells. With FLT-seq and FLAMES, we performed the first comprehensive characterization of the full-length isoform landscape in single cells of different types and species and identified thousands of unannotated isoforms. We found conserved functional modules that were enriched for alternative transcript usage in different cell populations, including ribosome biogenesis and mRNA splicing. Analysis at the transcript-level allowed data integration with scATAC-seq on individual promoters, improved correlation with protein expression data and linked mutations known to confer drug resistance to transcriptome heterogeneity. Our methods reveal previously unseen isoform complexity and provide a better framework for multi-omics data integration.	412	1.1279945242984257	23	63	10	0.024271844660194174	70.25

While single-cell genomics identifies tissues’ cellular components, deciphering their coordinated action remains a major challenge. Here, we tackle this problem through a new framework of multicellular programs: combinations of distinct cellular programs in different cell types that are coordinatedtogetherin the tissue, thus forming a higher order functional unit at the tissue, rather than only cell, level. We develop the open-access DIALOGUE algorithm to systematically uncover such multi-cellular programs not only from spatial data, but even from tissue dissociated and profiled as single cells,e.g., by single-cell RNA-Seq. Tested on spatial transcriptomes from the mouse hypothalamus, DIALOGUE recovered spatial information, predicted the properties of a cell’s environment only based on its transcriptome, and identified multicellular programs that mark animal behavior. Applied to brain samples and colon biopsies profiled by scRNA-Seq, DIALOGUE identified multicellular configurations that mark Alzheimer’s disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), including a program spanning five cell types that is predictive of response to anti-TNF therapy in UC patients and enriched for UC risk genes from GWAS, each acting in different cell types, but all cells acting in concert. Taken together, our study provides a novel conceptual and methodological framework to unravel multicellular regulation in health and disease.	411	1.1252566735112937	2	70	2	0.004866180048661801	5.45

Existing implementations for inferring its parameters from data often struggle with the size of single cell datasets, which typically comprise thousands or millions of cells; at the same time, they do not take full advantage of the fact that zero and other small numbers are frequent in the data. These limitations have hampered uptake of the model, leaving room for statistically inferior approaches such as logarithm(-like) transformation.We present a new R package for fitting the Gamma-Poisson distribution to data with the characteristics of modern single cell datasets more quickly and more accurately than existing methods. The software can work with data on disk without having to load them into RAM simultaneously.The package glmGamPoi is available from Bioconductor (since release 3.11) for Windows, macOS, and Linux, and source code is available on GitHub under a GPL-3 license.

RNA-seq is often performed on heterogeneous samples and the resulting DEGs do not necessarily indicate the cell types where the differential expression occurred. While single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) methods solve this problem, technical and cost constraints currently limit its widespread use. Here we present single cell Mapper (scMappR), a method that assigns cell-type specificity scores to DEGs obtained from bulk RNA-seq by integrating cell-type expression data generated by scRNA-seq and existing deconvolution methods. After benchmarking scMappR using RNA-seq data obtained from sorted blood cells, we asked if scMappR could reveal known cell-type specific changes that occur during kidney regeneration. We found that scMappR appropriately assigned DEGs to cell-types involved in kidney regeneration, including a relatively small proportion of immune cells. While scMappR can work with any user supplied scRNA-seq data, we curated scRNA-seq expression matrices for ∼100 human and mouse tissues to facilitate its use with bulk RNA-seq data alone. Overall, scMappR is a user-friendly R package that complements traditional differential expression analysis available at CRAN.scMappR integrates scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq to re-calibrate bulk differentially expressed genes (DEGs).scMappR correctly identified immune-cell expressed DEGs from a bulk RNA-seq analysis of mouse kidney regeneration.scMappR is deployed as a user-friendly R package available at CRAN.	397	1.0869267624914443	9	64	0	0	30.88
10.1101/2020.08.25.267021	FALSE	TRUE	PieParty: Visualizing cells from scRNA-seq data as pie charts	2020-08-26	Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been a transformative technology in many research fields. Dimensional reduction techniques such as UMAP and tSNE are used to visualize scRNA-seq data in two or three dimensions in order for cells to be clustered in biologically meaningful ways. Subsequently, gene expression is frequently mapped onto these plots to show the distribution of gene expression across the plots, for instance to distinguish cell types. However, plotting each cell with only one color leads to repetitive and unintuitive representations. Here, we present Pie Party, which allows scRNA-seq data to be plotted such that every cell is represented as a pie chart, and every slice in the pie charts corresponds to the gene expression of individual genes. This allows for the simultaneous visualization of the expression of multiple genes and gene networks. The resulting figures are information dense, space efficient and highly intuitive.

10.1101/2020.08.26.269332	FALSE	TRUE	Generative modeling of single-cell population time series for inferring cell differentiation landscapes	2020-08-27	Existing computational methods that use single-cell RNA-sequencing for cell fate prediction either summarize observations of cell states and their couplings without modeling the underlying differentiation process, or are limited in their capacity to model complex differentiation landscapes. Thus, contemporary methods cannot predict how cells evolve stochastically and in physical time from an arbitrary starting expression state, nor can they model the cell fate consequences of gene expression perturbations. We introduce PRESCIENT (Potential eneRgy undErlying Single Cell gradIENTs), a generative modeling framework that learns an underlying differentiation landscape from single-cell time-series gene expression data. Our generative model framework provides insight into the process of differentiation and can simulate differentiation trajectories for arbitrary gene expression progenitor states. We validate our method on a recently published experimental lineage tracing dataset that provides observed trajectories. We show that this model is able to predict the fate biases of progenitor cells in neutrophil/macrophage lineages when accounting for cell proliferation, improving upon the best-performing existing method. We also show how a model can predict trajectories for cells not found in the model’s training set, including cells in which genes or sets of genes have been perturbed. PRESCIENT is able to accommodate complex perturbations of multiple genes, at different time points and from different starting cell populations. PRESCIENT models are able to recover the expected effects of known modulators of cell fate in hematopoiesis and pancreatic β cell differentiation.	395	1.08145106091718	3	41	1	0.002531645569620253	23.53

Here we present the first single-cell investigation of differential isoform expression (DIE) between brain regions, by performing single cell long-read transcriptome sequencing in the mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in 45 cell types at postnatal day 7 (www.isoformAtlas.com). Using isoform tests for brain-region specific DIE, which outperform exon-based tests, we detect hundreds of brain-region specific DIE events traceable to specific cell-types. Many DIE events correspond to functionally distinct protein isoforms, some with just a 6-nucleotide exon variant. In most instances, one cell type is responsible for brain-region specific DIE. Cell types indigenous to only one anatomic structure display distinctive DIE, where for example, the choroid plexus epithelium manifest unique transcription start sites. However, for some genes, multiple cell-types are responsible for DIE in bulk data, indicating that regional identity can, although less frequently, override cell-type specificity. We validated our findings with spatial transcriptomics and long-read sequencing, yielding the first spatially resolved splicing map in the postnatal mouse brain (www.isoformAtlas.com). Our methods are highly generalizable. They provide a robust means of quantifying isoform expression with cell-type and spatial resolution, and reveal how the brain integrates molecular and cellular complexity to serve function.	395	1.08145106091718	28	87	2	0.005063291139240506	95.684

Targetedin situtechnologies1–3solve both issues, but are limited in gene throughput which impedes profiling of the entire transcriptome. Finally, as samples are collected for profiling, their registration to anatomical atlases often require human supervision, which is a major obstacle to build pipelines at scale. Here, we demonstrate spatial mapping of cells, histology, and anatomy in the somatomotor area and the visual area of the healthy adult mouse brain. We devise Tangram, a method that aligns snRNA-seq data to various forms of spatial data collected from the same brain region, including MERFISH1, STARmap2, smFISH3, and Spatial Transcriptomics4(Visium), as well as histological images and public atlases. Tangram can map any type of sc/snRNA-seq data, including multi-modal data such as SHARE-seq data5, which we used to reveal spatial patterns of chromatin accessibility. We equipped Tangram with a deep learning computer vision pipeline, which allows for automatic identification of anatomical annotations on histological images of mouse brain. By doing so, Tangram reconstructs a genome-wide, anatomically-integrated, spatial map of the visual and somatomotor area with ∼30,000 genes at single-cell resolution, revealing spatial gene expression and chromatin accessibility patterning beyond current limitation ofin-situtechnologies.	392	1.0732375085557837	20	45	18	0.04591836734693878	32.6
10.1101/2020.08.31.276345	FALSE	TRUE	cFIT: Integration and transfer learning of single cell transcriptomes, illustrated by fetal brain cell development	2020-08-31	Large, comprehensive collections of scRNA-seq data sets have been generated that allow for the full transcriptional characterization of cell types across a wide variety of biological and clinical conditions. As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these data sets or transfer knowledge from one to the other to better understand cellular identity and functions. Here, we present a simple yet surprisingly effective method named cFIT for capturing various batch effects across experiments, technologies, subjects, and even species. The proposed method models the shared information between various data sets by a common factor space, while allowing for unique distortions and shifts in gene-wise expression in each batch. The model parameters are learned under an iterative non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) framework and then used for synchronized integration from across-domain assays. In addition, the model enables transferring via low-rank matrix from more informative data to allow for precise identification in data of lower quality. Compared to existing approaches, our method imposes weaker assumptions on the cell composition of each individual data set, however, is shown to be more reliable in preserving biological variations. We apply cFIT to multiple scRNA-seq data sets of developing brain from human and mouse, varying by technologies and developmental stages. The successful integration and transfer uncover the transcriptional resemblance across systems. The study helps establish a comprehensive landscape of brain cell type diversity and provides insights into brain development.	391	1.0704996577686516	5	40	1	0.0025575447570332483	4

Still, however, accurate inference of trajectory is challenging. Recent development of RNA velocity provides an approach to visualize cell state transition without relying on prior knowledge. To perform TI and group cells based on RNA velocity we developed VeTra. By applying cosine similarity and merging weakly connected components, VeTra identifies cell groups from the direction of cell transition. Besides, VeTra suggests key regulators from the inferred trajectory. VeTra is a useful tool for TI and subsequent analysis.	390	1.0677618069815196	3	31	1	0.002564102564102564	33.48

Fast-growing scRNA-seq profiles require efficient clustering algorithms to identify the same type of cells. Although many methods have been developed for cell clustering, existing clustering methods are limited to extract the representations from expression data of individual cells, while ignoring the high-order structural relations between cells. Here, we proposed GraphSCC, a robust graph artificial intelligence model to cluster single cells by accounting for structural relations between cells. The representation learned from the graph convolutional network, together with another representation output from a denoising autoencoder network, are optimized by a dual self-supervised module for better cell clustering. The experimental results indicate that GraphSCC model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of various evaluation metrics on both simulated and real datasets. Further visualizations show that GraphSCC provides representations for better intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster separability.	388	1.0622861054072552	5	47	2	0.005154639175257732	9.83
10.1101/2020.09.10.290973	FALSE	TRUE	DTFLOW: Inference and Visualization of Single-cell Pseudo-temporal Trajectories Using Diffusion Propagation	2020-09-11	One of the major challenges in single-cell data analysis is the determination of cellular developmental trajectories using single-cell data. Although substantial studies have been conducted in recent years, more effective methods are still strongly needed to infer the developmental processes accurately. In this work we devise a new method, named DTFLOW, for determining the pseudo-temporal trajectories with multiple branches. This method consists of two major steps: namely a new dimension reduction method (i.e. Bhattacharyya kernel feature decomposition (BKFD)) and a novel approach, named Reverse Searching on kNN Graph (RSKG), to identify the underlying multi-branching processes of cellular differentiations. In BKFD we first establish a stationary distribution for each cell to represent the transition of cellular developmental states based on the random walk with restart algorithm and then propose a new distance metric for calculating pseudo-times of single-cells by introducing the Bhattacharyya kernel matrix. The effectiveness of DTFLOW is rigorously examined by using four single-cell datasets. We compare the efficiency of the new method with two state-of-the-art methods. Simulation results suggest that our proposed method has superior accuracy and strong robustness properties for constructing pseudo-time trajectories.

10.1101/2020.09.16.300822	FALSE	TRUE	HieRFIT: Hierarchical Random Forest for Information Transfer	2020-09-18	The emergence of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has led to an explosion in novel methods to study biological variation among individual cells, and to classify cells into functional and biologically meaningful categories. Here, we present a new cell type projection tool, HieRFIT (Hierarchical Random Forest for Information Transfer), based on hierarchical random forests. HieRFIT uses a priori information about cell type relationships to improve classification accuracy, taking as input a hierarchical tree structure representing the class relationships, along with the reference data. We use an ensemble approach combining multiple random forest models, organized in a hierarchical decision tree structure. We show that our hierarchical classification approach improves accuracy and reduces incorrect predictions especially for inter-dataset tasks which reflect real life applications. We use a scoring scheme that adjusts probability distributions for candidate class labels and resolves uncertainties while avoiding the assignment of cells to incorrect types by labeling cells at internal nodes of the hierarchy when necessary. Using HieRFIT, we re-analyzed publicly available scRNA-seq datasets showing its effectiveness in cell type cross-projections with inter/intra-species examples. HieRFIT is implemented as an R package and it is available at (https://github.com/yasinkaymaz/HieRFIT/releases/tag/v1.0.0)	373	1.0212183436002737	6	46	0	0	6.25
10.1101/2020.09.17.301911	FALSE	TRUE	Integrating scRNA-seq data of multiple donors increases cell-type identification accuracy	2020-09-19	We present scIntegral, a scalable and accurate method to identify cell types in scRNA data. Our method probabilistically identifies cell-types of the cells in a semi-supervised manner using marker list information as prior. scIntegral is more accurate than existing state-of-the-art methods, reducing the error rate by up to three-folds in real data. scIntegral can precisely identify very rare (&lt;0.5%) cell populations, suggesting utilities for in-silico cell extraction. A notable application of scIntegral is to systematically integrate scRNA-seq data of multiple donors with strong heterogeneity and batch effects. scIntegral is extremely efficient and takes only an hour to integrate ten thousand donor data, while fully accounting for heterogeneity with covariates. Many previous methods focused on integrating multi-sample data in the cluster level, but it was challenging to quantitatively measure the benefit of integration. We show that integrating multiple donors can significantly reduce the error rate in cell-type identification, when measured with respect to the gold standard cell labels. scIntegral is freely available at https://github.com/hanbin973/scIntegral.	372	1.0184804928131417	5	22	0	0	2

With the rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing technologies, it is now possible to investigate gene interactions in a cell-type-specific manner. Here we propose the scLink method, which uses statistical network modeling to understand the co-expression relationships among genes and to construct sparse gene co-expression networks from single-cell gene expression data. We use both simulation and real data studies to demonstrate the advantages of scLink and its ability to improve single-cell gene network analysis.

Most of the widely used methods for such analysis were developed for bulk expression data. Single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data offers several advantages including the large number of expression profiles available and the ability to focus on individual cells rather than averages. However, this data also raises new computational challenges.Using a novel encoding for scRNA-Seq expression data we develop deep learning methods for interaction prediction from time-course data. Our methods use a supervised framework which represents the data as a 3D tensor and train convolutional and recurrent neural networks (CNN and RNN) for predicting interactions. We tested our Time-course Deep Learning (TDL) models on five different time series scRNA-Seq datasets. As we show, TDL can accurately identify causal and regulatory gene-gene interactions and can also be used to assign new function to genes. TDL improves on prior methods for the above tasks and can be generally applied to new time series scRNA-Seq data.Freely available athttps://github.com/xiaoyeye/TDL.zivbj@cs.cmu.eduSupplementary data are available atXXXonline.	369	1.0102669404517455	2	37	0	0	11.43
10.1101/2020.09.23.310003	FALSE	TRUE	A Joint Deep Learning Model for Simultaneous Batch Effect Correction, Denoising and Clustering in Single-Cell Transcriptomics	2020-09-25	Recent development of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technologies has led to enormous biological discoveries. As the scale of scRNA-seq studies increases, a major challenge in analysis is batch effect, which is inevitable in studies involving human tissues. Most existing methods remove batch effect in a low-dimensional embedding space. Although useful for clustering, batch effect is still present in the gene expression space, leaving downstream gene-level analysis susceptible to batch effect. Recent studies have shown that batch effect correction in the gene expression space is much harder than in the embedding space. Popular methods such as Seurat3.0 rely on the mutual nearest neighbor (MNN) approach to remove batch effect in the gene expression space, but MNN can only analyze two batches at a time and it becomes computationally infeasible when the number of batches is large. Here we present CarDEC, a joint deep learning model that simultaneously clusters and denoises scRNA-seq data, while correcting batch effect both in the embedding and the gene expression space. Comprehensive evaluations spanning different species and tissues showed that CarDEC consistently outperforms scVI, DCA, and MNN. With CarDEC denoising, those non-highly variable genes offer as much signal for clustering as the highly variable genes, suggesting that CarDEC substantially boosted information content in scRNA-seq. We also showed that trajectory analysis using CarDEC’s denoised and batch corrected expression as input revealed marker genes and transcription factors that are otherwise obscured in the presence of batch effect. CarDEC is computationally fast, making it a desirable tool for large-scale scRNA-seq studies.	366	1.002053388090349	10	30	5	0.01366120218579235	50.33

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been extensively used to define cell subpopulations at the transcription level. Yet, most scRNA-seq data have not been analyzed in an “APA-aware” manner. Here, we introduce scDaPars, a bioinformatics algorithm to accurately quantify APA events at both single-cell and single-gene resolution using standard scRNA-seq data. Validations in both real and simulated data indicate that scDaPars can robustly recover missing APA events caused by the low amounts of mRNA sequenced in single cells. When applied to cancer and human endoderm differentiation data, scDaPars not only revealed cell-type-specific APA regulation but also identified cell subpopulations that are otherwise invisible to conventional gene expression analysis. Thus, scDaPars will enable us to understand cellular heterogeneity at the post-transcriptional APA level.	367	1.0047912388774811	4	47	1	0.0027247956403269754	13.18

However, with the lack of a mature high-throughput single cell metabolomics technology, we are yet to establish systematic understanding of intra-tissue metabolic heterogeneity and cooperation phenomena among cell populations. To mitigate this knowledge gap, we developed a novel computational method, namely scFEA (single cell Flux Estimation Analysis), to infer single cell fluxome from single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. scFEA is empowered by a comprehensively reconstructed human metabolic map into a factor graph, a novel probabilistic model to leverage the flux balance constraints on scRNA-seq data, and a novel graph neural network based optimization solver. The intricate information cascade from transcriptome to metabolome was captured using multi-layer neural networks to fully capitulate the non-linear dependency between enzymatic gene expressions and reaction rates. We experimentally validated scFEA by generating an scRNA-seq dataset with matched metabolomics data on cells of perturbed oxygen and genetic conditions. Application of scFEA on this dataset demonstrated the consistency between predicted flux and metabolic imbalance with the observed variation of metabolite abundance in the matched metabolomics data. We also applied scFEA on five publicly available scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics datasets and identified context and cell group specific metabolic variations. The cell-wise fluxome predicted by scFEA empowers a series of downstream analysis including identification of metabolic modules or cell groups that share common metabolic variations, sensitivity evaluation of enzymes with regards to their impact on the whole metabolic flux, and inference of cell-tissue and cell-cell metabolic communications.	367	1.0047912388774811	13	86	1	0.0027247956403269754	4.85
10.1101/2020.09.24.311662	FALSE	TRUE	NEBULA: a fast negative binomial mixed model for differential expression and co-expression analyses of large-scale multi-subject single-cell data	2020-09-25	The growing availability of large-scale single-cell data revolutionizes our understanding of biological mechanisms at a finer resolution. In differential expression and co-expression analyses of multi-subject single-cell data, it is important to take into account both subject-level and cell-level overdispersions through negative binomial mixed models (NBMMs). However, the application of NBMMs to large-scale single-cell data is computationally demanding. In this work, we propose an efficient NEgative Binomial mixed model Using a Large-sample Approximation (NEBULA)), which analytically solves the high-dimensional integral in the marginal likelihood instead of using the Laplace approximation. Our benchmarks show that NEBULA dramatically reduces the running time by orders of magnitude compared to existing tools. We showed that NEBULA controlled false positives in identifying marker genes, while a simple negative binomial model produced spurious associations. Leveraging NEBULA, we decomposed between-subject and within-subject overdispersions of an snRNA-seq data set in the frontal cortex comprising ∼80,000 cells from a cohort of 48 individuals for Alzheimer’s diseases (AD). We observed that subpopulations and known subject-level covariates contributed substantially to the overdispersions. We carried out cell-type-specific transcriptome-wide within-subject co-expression analysis of APOE. The results revealed that APOE was most co-expressed with multiple AD-related genes, including CLU and CST3 in astrocytes, TREM2 and C1q genes in microglia, and ITM2B, an inhibitor of the amyloid-beta peptide aggregation, in both cell types. We found that the co-expression patterns were different in APOE2+ and APOE4+ cells in microglia, which suggest an isoform-dependent regulatory role in the immune system through the complement system in microglia. NEBULA opens up a new avenue for the broad application of NBMMs in the analysis of large-scale multi-subject single-cell data.	366	1.002053388090349	2	68	2	0.00546448087431694	8.58
10.1101/2020.09.25.313882	FALSE	TRUE	Exponential-family embedding with application to cell developmental trajectories for single-cell RNA-seq data	2020-09-25	Scientists often embed cells into a lower-dimensional space when studying single-cell RNA-seq data for improved downstream analyses such as developmental trajectory analyses, but the statistical properties of such non-linear embedding methods are often not well understood. In this article, we develop the eSVD (exponential-family SVD), a non-linear embedding method for both cells and genes jointly with respect to a random dot product model using exponential-family distributions. Our estimator uses alternating minimization, which enables us to have a computationally-efficient method, prove the identifiability conditions and consistency of our method, and provide statistically-principled procedures to tune our method. All these qualities help advance the single-cell embedding literature, and we provide extensive simulations to demonstrate that the eSVD is competitive compared to other embedding methods.We apply the eSVD via Gaussian distributions where the standard deviations are proportional to the means to analyze a single-cell dataset of oligodendrocytes in mouse brains (Marques et al., 2016). Using the eSVD estimated embedding, we then investigate the cell developmental trajectories of the oligodendrocytes. While previous results are not able to distinguish the trajectories among the mature oligodendrocyte cell types, our diagnostics and results demonstrate there are two major developmental trajectories that diverge at mature oligodendrocytes.	366	1.002053388090349	3	88	0	0	1.5
10.1101/2020.09.28.316901	FALSE	TRUE	Dincta: Data Integration and Cell Type Annotation of Single Cell Transcriptomes	2020-09-30	We proposed a method for data integration and cell type annotation (Dincta) of single cell transcriptomes in a unify framework. The Dincta can handle three cases. In the first case, the data has been annotated the cell type for all cells, Dincta can integrate the the data into a common low dimension embedding space such that cells with different cell types separate while cells from the different batches but in the same cell type cluster together. In the second case, the data was only annotated for part of cells, such as one sample, Dincta can integrate the data into a common low dimension embedding space such that cells with different cell types separate while cells from the different batches but in the same cell type cluster together. Moreover, it can infer the known or novel cell type of the cells with unknown cell type initially. In the third case, there are no cell type information of cells, we can run Dincta in an unsupervised way. It can infer the number of new cell types and annotate the cells into its correspond cell type, and do data integration keeping cells from different cell type separate while removing the batch effects to mix cells in the same cell type. Dincta is simple, accurate and efficient to integrate data, which keeps the cell type information preserved while removes the batch effects, and infers the known or novel cell types of cells.	361	0.9883641341546886	1	8	0	0	8.58

Single-cell clustering using gene expression profiles is known to show different results depending on the method of expression quantification; nevertheless, most single-cell clustering methods do not consider the method.In this article, we propose a robust and highly accurate clustering method using joint non-negative matrix factorization (joint NMF) based on multiple gene expression profiles quantified using different methods. Matrix factorization is an excellent method for dimension reduction and feature extraction of data. In particular, NMF approximates the data matrix as the product of two matrices in which all factors are non-negative. Our joint NMF can extract common factors among multiple gene expression profiles by applying each NMF to them under the constraint that one of the factorized matrices is shared among the multiple NMFs. The joint NMF determines more robust and accurate cell clustering results by leveraging multiple quantification methods compared to the conventional clustering methods, which uses only a single quantification method. In conclusion, our study showed that our clustering method using multiple gene expression profiles is more accurate than other popular methods.	360	0.9856262833675564	4	21	0	0	8.93
10.1101/2020.09.30.321125	FALSE	TRUE	Inference of high-resolution trajectories in single cell RNA-Seq data from RNA velocity	2020-10-02	Trajectory inference methods are used to infer cell developmental trajectories in a continuous biological process, for example, stem cell differentiation. Most of the current trajectory inference methods infer the developmental trajectories based on transcriptome similarity between cells, using single cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data. These methods are often restricted to certain trajectory structures like linear structure or tree structure, and the directions of the trajectory can only be determined when the root cell is provided. On the other hand, RNA velocity inference method is shown to be a promising alternative in predicting short term cell developmental direction from the sequencing data. Here by we present CellPath, a single cell trajectory inference method that infers developmental trajectories by integrating RNA velocity information. CellPath is able to find multiple high-resolution cell developmental paths instead of a single backbone trajectory obtained from traditional trajectory inference methods, and it no longer constrains the trajectory structure to be of any specific topology. The direction information provided by RNA-velocity also allows CellPath to automatically detect the root cell and the direction of the dynamic process. We evaluate CellPath on both real and synthetic datasets, and show that CellPath finds more accurate and detailed trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art trajectory inference methods.	359	0.9828884325804244	2	52	3	0.008356545961002786	55.18

However, large data sets do not necessarily contain large amounts of information. Here, we introduce a formal framework for assessing the amount of information obtained from a sc-Seq experiment, which can be used throughout the sc-Seq analysis pipeline, including for quality control, feature selection and cluster evaluation. We illustrate this framework with some simple examples, including using it to quantify the amount of information in a single-cell sequencing data set that is explained by a proposed clustering, and thereby to determine cluster quality. Our information-theoretic framework provides a formal way to assess the quality of data obtained from sc-Seq experiments and the effectiveness of analyses performed, with wide implications for our understanding of variability in gene expression patterns within heterogeneous cell populations.	360	0.9856262833675564	3	19	0	0	7.65

Single-cell technology has made it possible to measure gene expression in individual cells, achieving higher resolution at the expense of increased noise. If carefully incorporated, such single-cell data can be used to deconvolve bulk samples to yield accurate estimates of the true cell type proportions, thus enabling one to disentangle the effects of differential expression and cell type mixtures. Here, we propose a generative model and a likelihood-based inference method that uses asymptotic statistical theory and a novel optimization procedure to perform deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data to produce accurate cell type proportion estimates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, called RNA-Sieve, across a diverse array of scenarios involving real data and discuss extensions made uniquely possible by our probabilistic framework, including a demonstration of well-calibrated confidence intervals.	359	0.9828884325804244	4	42	0	0	36.13

However, the performance of such methods varies greatly between datasets, they require post hoc tuning of cryptic hyperparameters, and they are often not transferable to other types of data. Here we present a novel generic clustering approach called k minimal distances (KMD) clustering, based on a simple generalization of single and average linkage hierarchical clustering. We show how a generalized silhouette-like function is predictive of clustering accuracy and exploit this property to eliminate the main hyperparameter k. We evaluated KMD clustering on standard simulated datasets, simulated datasets with high noise added, mass cytometry datasets and scRNA-seq datasets. When compared to standard generic and state-of-the-art specialized algorithms, KMD clustering’s performance was consistently better or comparable to that of the best algorithm on each of the tested datasets.	357	0.9774127310061602	2	29	0	0	30.23

Specifically, we extend t-SNE, UMAP, and PHATE to include known or predicted class labels and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Our approach, “Haisu,” is applicable across domains and methods of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. In general, the mathematical effect of Haisu can be summarized as a variable perturbation of the high dimensional space in which the original data is observed. We thereby preserve the core characteristics of the visualization method and only change the manifold to respect known or assumed class labels when provided. Our strategy is designed to aid in the discovery and understanding of underlying patterns in a dataset that is heavily influenced by parent-child relationships. We show that using our approach can also help in semi-supervised settings where labels are known for only some datapoints (for instance when only a fraction of the cells is labeled). In summary, Haisu extends existing popular visualization methods to enable a user to incorporate known, relevant relationships via a user-defined hierarchical distancing factor.github.com/Cobanoglu-Lab/Haisu	354	0.9691991786447639	2	26	0	0	15.53
10.1101/2020.10.06.327601	FALSE	TRUE	JIND: Joint Integration and Discrimination for Automated Single-Cell Annotation	2020-10-07	Single-cell RNA-seq is a powerful tool in the study of the cellular composition of different tissues and organisms. A key step in the analysis pipeline is the annotation of cell-types based on the expression of specific marker genes. Since manual annotation is labor-intensive and does not scale to large datasets, several methods for automated cell-type annotation have been proposed based on supervised learning. However, these methods generally require feature extraction and batch alignment prior to classification, and their performance may become unreliable in the presence of cell-types with very similar transcriptomic profiles, such as differentiating cells. We propose JIND, a framework for automated cell-type identification based on neural networks that directly learns a low-dimensional representation (latent code) in which cell-types can be reliably determined. To account for batch effects, JIND performs a novel asymmetric alignment in which the transcriptomic profile of unseen cells is mapped onto the previously learned latent space, hence avoiding the need of retraining the model whenever a new dataset becomes available. JIND also learns cell-type-specific confidence thresholds to identify and reject cells that cannot be reliably classified. We show on datasets with and without batch effects that JIND classifies cells more accurately than previously proposed methods while rejecting only a small proportion of cells. Moreover, JIND batch alignment is parallelizable, being more than five or six times faster than Seurat integration.

10.1101/2020.10.07.330563	FALSE	TRUE	DUBStepR: correlation-based feature selection for clustering single-cell RNA sequencing data	2020-10-08	Feature selection (marker gene selection) is widely believed to improve clustering accuracy, and is thus a key component of single cell clustering pipelines. However, we found that the performance of existing feature selection methods was inconsistent across benchmark datasets, and occasionally even worse than without feature selection. Moreover, existing methods ignored information contained in gene-gene correlations. We therefore developed DUBStepR (Determining the Underlying Basis using Stepwise Regression), a feature selection algorithm that leverages gene-gene correlations with a novel measure of inhomogeneity in feature space, termed the Density Index (DI). Despite selecting a relatively small number of genes, DUBStepR substantially outperformed existing single-cell feature selection methods across diverse clustering benchmarks. In a published scRNA-seq dataset from sorted monocytes, DUBStepR sensitively detected a rare and previously invisible population of contaminating basophils. DUBStepR is scalable to over a million cells, and can be straightforwardly applied to other data types such as single-cell ATAC-seq. We propose DUBStepR as a general-purpose feature selection solution for accurately clustering single-cell data.	353	0.9664613278576317	12	33	1	0.0028328611898017	27.63

We present dropkick, a fully automated software tool for quality control and filtering of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data with a focus on excluding ambient barcodes and recovering real cells bordering the quality threshold. By automatically determining dataset-specific training labels based on predictive global heuristics, dropkick learns a gene-based representation of real cells and ambient noise, calculating a cell probability score for each barcode. Using simulated and real-world scRNA-seq data, we benchmarked dropkick against a conventional thresholding approach and EmptyDrops, a popular computational method, demonstrating greater recovery of rare cell types and exclusion of empty droplets and noisy, uninformative barcodes. We show for both low and high-background datasets that dropkick’s weakly supervised model reliably learns which genes are enriched in ambient barcodes and draws a multidimensional boundary that is more robust to dataset-specific variation than existing filtering approaches. dropkick provides a fast, automated tool for reproducible cell identification from scRNA-seq data that is critical to downstream analysis and compatible with popular single-cell analysis Python packages.	352	0.9637234770704997	5	30	1	0.002840909090909091	11.65

Techniques for gene selection in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are seemingly simple which casts problems with respect to the resolution of (sub-)types detection, marker selection and ultimately impacts towards cell annotation. We introduce sc-REnF, a novel and robust entropy based feature (gene) selection method, which leverages the landmark advantage of ‘Renyi’ and ‘Tsallis’ entropy achieved in their original application, in single cell clustering. Thereby, gene selection is robust and less sensitive towards the technical noise present in the data, producing a pure clustering of cells, beyond classifying independent and unknown sample with utmost accuracy.

Here, we introduce ‘weighted-nearest neighbor’ analysis, an unsupervised framework to learn the relative utility of each data type in each cell, enabling an integrative analysis of multiple modalities. We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of hundreds of thousands of human white blood cells alongside a panel of 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. We demonstrate that integrative analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states and validate the presence of previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets, and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and COVID-19. Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyze single-cell multimodal datasets, including paired measurements of RNA and chromatin state, and to look beyond the transcriptome towards a unified and multimodal definition of cellular identity.Installation instructions, documentation, tutorials, and CITE-seq datasets are available at http://www.satijalab.org/seurat	349	0.9555099247091033	25	59	85	0.24355300859598855	237.18

However, trajectory inference requires that the direction of a biological process is known, largely limiting its application to differentiating systems in normal development. Here, we present CellRank (https://cellrank.org) for mapping the fate of single cells in diverse scenarios, including perturbations such as regeneration or disease, for which direction is unknown. Our approach combines the robustness of trajectory inference with directional information from RNA velocity, derived from ratios of spliced to unspliced reads. CellRank takes into account both the gradual and stochastic nature of cellular fate decisions, as well as uncertainty in RNA velocity vectors. On data from pancreas development, we show that it automatically detects initial, intermediate and terminal populations, predicts fate potentials and visualizes continuous gene expression trends along individual lineages. CellRank also predicts a novel dedifferentiation trajectory during regeneration after lung injury, which we follow up experimentally by confirming the existence of previously unknown intermediate cell states.	341	0.9336071184120466	12	160	20	0.05865102639296188	202.61

The advent of single cell RNA-sequencing allows us to examine more subtle gene co-expression occurring within a cell type. Many imputation and denoising methods have been developed to deal with the technical challenges observed in single cell data; meanwhile, several simulators have been developed for benchmarking and assessing these methods. Most of these simulators, however, either do not incorporate gene co-expression or generate co-expression in an inconvenient manner.Therefore, with the focus on gene co-expression, we propose a new simulator, ESCO, which adopts the idea of the copula to impose gene co-expression, while preserving the highlights of available simulators, which perform well for simulation of gene expression marginally. Using ESCO, we assess the performance of imputation methods on GCN recovery and find that imputation generally helps GCN recovery when the data are not too sparse, and the ensemble imputation method works best among leading methods. In contrast, imputation fails to help in the presence of an excessive fraction of zero counts, where simple data aggregating methods are a better choice. These findings are further verified with mouse and human brain cell data.The ESCO implementation is available as R package SplatterESCO (https://github.com/JINJINT/SplatterESCO).roeder@andrew.cmu.edu	340	0.9308692676249144	3	35	1	0.0029411764705882353	9.434

Whilst it is often the case that data is deposited for future bioinformatic analysis many studies do not release their data in a way that is easy to explore by non-computational researchers.In order to help address this we have developed ShinyCell, an R package that converts single-cell RNA sequencing datasets into explorable and shareable interactive interfaces. These interfaces can be easily customised in order to maximise their usability and can be easily uploaded to online platforms to facilitate wider access to published data.ShinyCell is available at https://github.com/SGDDNB/ShinyCell.owen.rackham@duke-nus.edu.sg	335	0.917180013689254	4	12	0	0	13.95

The majority of methods for normalizing single-cell RNA-sequencing data adjust average expression in sequencing depth, but allow the variance and other properties of the gene-specific expression distribution to be non-constant in depth, which often results in reduced power and increased false discoveries in downstream analyses. This problem is exacerbated by the high proportion of zeros present in most datasets.To address this, we present Dino, a normalization method based on a flexible negative-binomial mixture model of gene expression. As demonstrated in both simulated and case study datasets, by normalizing the entire gene expression distribution, Dino is robust to shallow sequencing depth, sample heterogeneity, and varying zero proportions, leading to improved performance in downstream analyses in a number of settings.The R package, Dino, is available on GitHub at https://github.com/JBrownBiostat/Dino.brownj@biostat.wisc.edu, kendzior@biostat.wisc.edu	332	0.9089664613278576	5	30	0	0	2.6

However, effective approaches for the integrative analysis of such data are challenging. Although achieved state-of-the-art performance on single-cell multi-omics data integration and did not require any correspondence information, either among cells or among features, current manifold alignment based integrative methods are often limited by requiring that single-cell datasets be derived from the same underlying cellular structure. To overcome this limitation, we present Pamona, an algorithm that integrates heterogeneous single-cell multi-omics datasets with the aim of delineating and representing the shared and dataset-specific cellular structures. We formulate this task as a partial manifold alignment problem and develop a partial Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport framework to solve it. Pamona identifies both shared and dataset-specific cells based on the computed probabilistic couplings of cells across datasets, and it aligns cellular modalities in a common low-dimensional space, while simultaneously preserving both shared and dataset-specific structures. Our framework can easily incorporate prior information, such as cell type annotations or cell-cell correspondence, to further improve alignment quality. Simulation studies and applications to four real data sets demonstrate that Pamona can accurately identify shared and dataset-specific cells, as well as faithfully recover and align cellular structures of heterogeneous single-cell modalities in the common space.

10.1101/2020.11.04.368019	FALSE	TRUE	Computational identification of splicing phenotypes from single cell transcriptomic experiments	2020-11-05	RNA splicing is an important driver of heterogeneity in single cells, both through the expression of alternative transcripts and as a major determinant of transcriptional kinetics. However, the intrinsic coverage limitations of scRNA-seq technologies make it challenging to associate specific splicing events to cell-level phenotypes. Here, we present BRIE2, a scalable computational method that resolves these issues by regressing single-cell transcriptomic data against cell-level features. We show that BRIE2 effectively identifies differential alternative splicing events that are associated with a disease. Additionally, BRIE2 allows a principled selection of genes (differential momentum genes) that capture heterogeneity in transcriptional kinetics and improve quantitatively RNA velocity analyses. BRIE2, therefore, extends the scope of single-cell transcriptomic experiments towards the identification of splicing phenotypes associated with biological changes at the single-cell level.	325	0.8898015058179329	2	33	2	0.006153846153846154	15.18

Specifically, the investigation of functional gene modules (FGM) can help to understand gene interactive networks and complex biological processes. QUBIC2 is recognized as one of the most efficient and effective tools for FGM identification from scRNA-Seq data. However, its limited availability to a C implementation restricted its application to only a few downstream analyses functionalities. We developed an R package named IRIS-FGM (Integrative scRNA-Seq Interpretation System for Functional Gene Module analysis) to support the investigation of FGMs and cell clustering using scRNA-Seq data. Empowered by QUBIC2, IRIS-FGM can effectively identify co-expressed and co-regulated FGMs, predict cell types/clusters, uncover differentially expressed genes, and perform functional enrichment analysis. It is noteworthy that IRIS-FGM can also takes Seurat objects as input, which facilitate easy integration with existing analysis pipeline.IRIS-FGM is implemented in R environment (as of version 3.6) with the source code freely available at https://github.com/OSU-BMBL/IRIS-FGMqin.ma@osumc.eduSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	325	0.8898015058179329	7	18	0	0	9.33
10.1101/2020.11.05.370197	FALSE	TRUE	Multi-resolution characterization of molecular taxonomies in bulk and single-cell transcriptomics data	2020-11-05	As high-throughput genomics assays become more efficient and cost effective, their utilization has become standard in large-scale biomedical projects. These studies are often explorative, in that relationships between samples are not explicitly defined a priori, but rather emerge from data-driven discovery and annotation of molecular subtypes, thereby informing hypotheses and independent evaluation. Here, we present K2Taxonomer, a novel unsupervised recursive partitioning algorithm and associated R package that utilize ensemble learning to identify robust subgroups in a “taxonomy-like” structure (https://github.com/montilab/K2Taxonomer). K2Taxonomer was devised to accommodate different data paradigms, and is suitable for the analysis of both bulk and single-cell transcriptomics data. For each of these data types, we demonstrate the power of K2Taxonomer to discover known relationships in both simulated and human tissue data. We conclude with a practical application on breast cancer tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) single-cell profiles, in which we identified co-expression of translational machinery genes as a dominant transcriptional program shared by T cells subtypes, associated with better prognosis in breast cancer tissue bulk expression data.	325	0.8898015058179329	2	82	1	0.003076923076923077	3.35
10.1101/2020.11.09.375550	FALSE	TRUE	BABEL enables cross-modality translation between multi-omic profiles at single-cell resolution	2020-11-10	Simultaneous profiling of multi-omic modalities within a single cell is a grand challenge for single-cell biology. While there have been impressive technical innovations demonstrating feasibility – for example generating paired measurements of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq – wide-spread application of joint profiling is challenging due to the experimental complexity, noise, and cost. Here we introduce BABEL, a deep learning method that translates between the transcriptome and chromatin profiles of a single cell. Leveraging a novel interoperable neural network model, BABEL can generate scRNA-seq directly from a cell’s scATAC-seq, and vice versa. This makes it possible to computationally synthesize paired multi-omic measurements when only one modality is experimentally available. Across several paired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets in human and mouse, we validate that BABEL accurately translates between these modalities for individual cells. BABEL also generalizes well to new biological contexts not seen during training. For example, starting from scATAC-seq of patient derived basal cell carcinoma (BCC), BABEL generated scRNA-seq that enabled fine-grained classification of complex cell states, despite having never seen BCC data. These predictions are comparable to analyses of the experimental BCC scRNA-seq data. We further show that BABEL can incorporate additional single-cell data modalities, such as CITE-seq, thus enabling translation across chromatin, RNA, and protein. BABEL offers a powerful approach for data exploration and hypothesis generation.	320	0.8761122518822724	4	47	0	0	35.18

One state-of-the-art strategy for batch effect correction is via unsupervised or supervised detection of mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs). However, both two kinds of methods only detect MNNs across batches on the top of uncorrected data, where the large batch effect may affect the MNN search. To address this issue, we presented iSMNN, a batch effect correction approach via iterative supervised MNN refinement across data after correction. Our benchmarking on both simulation and real datasets showed the advantages of the iterative refinement of MNNs on the performance of correction. Compared to popular alternative methods, our iSMNN is able to better mix the cells of the same cell type across batches. In addition, iSMNN can also facilitate the identification of differentially expression genes (DEGs) relevant to the biological function of certain cell types. These results indicated that iSMNN will be a valuable method for integrating multiple scRNA-seq datasets that can facilitate biological and medical studies at single-cell level.	320	0.8761122518822724	8	26	0	0	9.68

Variational autoencoders offer means to characterize large datasets and have been used effectively to characterize features of single-cell datasets. Here we extend these methods for use with gene expression time series data. We present RVAgene: a recurrent variational autoencoder to model gene expression dynamics. RVAgene learns to accurately and efficiently reconstruct temporal gene profiles. It also learns a low dimensional representation of the data via a recurrent encoder network that can be used for biological feature discovery, and can generate new gene expression data by sampling from the latent space. We test RVAgene on simulated and real biological datasets, including embryonic stem cell differentiation and kidney injury response dynamics. In all cases, RVAgene accurately reconstructed complex gene expression temporal profiles. Via cross validation, we show that a low-error latent space representation can be learnt using only a fraction of the data. Through clustering and gene ontology term enrichment analysis on the latent space, we demonstrate the potential of RVAgene for unsupervised discovery. In particular, RVAgene identifies new programs of shared gene regulation of Lox family genes in response to kidney injury.	319	0.8733744010951403	2	49	1	0.003134796238244514	4.45

In this article, we propose to borrow information through known biological networks to increase statistical power to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs).We develop MRFscRNAseq, which is based on a Markov Random Field (MRF) model to appropriately accommodate gene network information as well as dependencies among cell types to identify cell-type specific DEGs. We implement an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with mean field-like approximation to estimate model parameters and a Gibbs sampler to infer DE status. Simulation study shows that our method has better power to detect cell-type specific DEGs than conventional methods while appropriately controlling type I error rate. The usefulness of our method is demonstrated through its application to study the pathogenesis and biological processes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) using a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data set, which contains 18,150 protein-coding genes across 38 cell types on lung tissues from 32 IPF patients and 28 normal controls.The proposed MRF model is implemented in the R package MRFscRNAseq available on GitHub.

We present сell2location, a principled and versatile Bayesian model that integrates single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to map cell types in situ in a comprehensive manner. We show that сell2location outperforms existing tools in accuracy and comprehensiveness and we demonstrate its utility by mapping two complex tissues. In the mouse brain, we use a new paired single nucleus and spatial RNA-sequencing dataset to map dozens of cell types and identify tissue regions in an automated manner. We discover novel regional astrocyte subtypes including fine subpopulations in the thalamus and hypothalamus. In the human lymph node, we resolve spatially interlaced immune cell states and identify co-located groups of cells underlying tissue organisation. We spatially map a rare pre-germinal centre B-cell population and predict putative cellular interactions relevant to the interferon response.

However, in single-cell data, a cell population can be a mixture of many cell types/cell states, hence the mean expression of genes cannot represent the whole population. In addition, these tools assume that gene expression of a population belongs to a specific family of distribution. This assumption is often violated in single-cell data. In this work, we define marker genes of a cell population as genes that can be used to distinguish cells in the population from cells in other populations. Besides log-fold change, we devise a new metric to classify genes into up-regulated, down-regulated, and transitional states. In a benchmark for finding up-regulated and down-regulated genes, our tool outperforms all compared methods, including Seurat, ROTS, scDD, edgeR, MAST, limma, normal t-test, Wilcoxon and Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Our method is much faster than all compared methods, therefore, enables interactive analysis for large single-cell data sets in BioTuring Browser.

However, a variety of technical artifacts can be present in scRNA-seq data and need to be assessed before downstream analyses can be performed. While several algorithms and tools have been developed to perform individual quality control (QC) tasks, they are scattered in different packages across several programming environments. Comprehensive pipelines to streamline the process of generating and visualizing QC metrics are lacking. To address this need, we built the SCTK-QC pipeline within thesingleCellTKR package (https://github.com/compbiomed/singleCellTK). Features in this pipeline include the ability to import data from 11 different preprocessing tools or file formats, perform empty droplet detection with 2 different algorithms, generate standard quality control metrics such as number of UMIs per cell or the percentage of mitochondrial counts, predict doublets using 6 different algorithms, and estimate ambient RNA. QC data can be exported to R and/or Python objects used in popular down-stream workflows. Results are visualized in an easy-to-read HTML report. This pipeline can also be used by non-computational users with an interactive graphical user interface developed with R/Shiny. Overall, the SCTK-QC pipeline will streamline and standardize QC analysis for scRNA-seq data across a variety of different single-cell transcriptomic platforms and preprocessing tools.	313	0.8569472963723477	14	28	0	0	7.45

Although dozens of simulators have been developed for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, they lack the capacity to simultaneously achieve all the three goals: preserving genes, capturing gene correlations, and generating any number of cells with varying sequencing depths. To fill in this gap, here we propose scDesign2, a transparent simulator that achieves all the three goals and generates high-fidelity synthetic data for multiple scRNA-seq protocols and other single-cell gene expression count-based technologies. Compared with existing simulators, scDesign2 is advantageous in its transparent use of probabilistic models and is unique in its ability to capture gene correlations via copula. We verify that scDesign2 generates more realistic synthetic data for four scRNA-seq protocols (10x Genomics, CEL-Seq2, Fluidigm C1, and Smart-Seq2) and two single-cell spatial transcriptomics protocols (MERFISH and pciSeq) than existing simulators do. Under two typical computational tasks, cell clustering and rare cell type detection, we demonstrate that scDesign2 provides informative guidance on deciding the optimal sequencing depth and cell number in single-cell RNA-seq experimental design, and that scDesign2 can effectively benchmark computational methods under varying sequencing depths and cell numbers. With these advantages, scDesign2 is a powerful tool for single-cell researchers to design experiments, develop computational methods, and choose appropriate methods for specific data analysis needs.	310	0.8487337440109514	4	114	0	0	10.33

Most of the existing supervised learning approaches only utilize annotated cells in the training step while ignoring the more abundant unannotated cells. In this paper, we proposed scPretrain, a multi-task self-supervised learning approach that jointly considers annotated and unannotated cells for cell type classification. scPretrain consists of a pre-training step and a fine-tuning step. In the pre-training step, scPretrain uses a multi-task learning framework to train a feature extraction encoder based on each dataset’s pseudo-labels, where only unannotated cells are used. In the fine-tuning step, scPretrain fine-tunes this feature extraction encoder using the limited annotated cells in a new dataset. We evaluated scPretrain on 60 diverse datasets from different technologies, species and organs, and obtained a significant improvement on both cell type classification and cell clustering. Moreover, the representations obtained by scPretrain in the pre-training step also enhanced the performance of conventional classifiers such as random forest, logistic regression and support vector machines. scPretrain is able to effectively utilize the massive amount of unlabelled data and be applied to annotating increasingly generated scRNA-seq datasets.https://github.com/ruiyi-zhang/scPretrain\	310	0.8487337440109514	5	41	0	0	0.75

Much like mapping sequencing reads to a reference genome, it is essential to be able to map query cells onto complex, multimillion-cell reference atlases to rapidly identify relevant cell states and phenotypes. We present Symphony (https://github.com/immunogenomics/symphony), an algorithm for building integrated reference atlases of millions of cells in a convenient, portable format that enables efficient query mapping within seconds. Symphony localizes query cells within a stable low-dimensional reference embedding, facilitating reproducible downstream transfer of reference-defined annotations to the query. We demonstrate the power of Symphony by (1) mapping a multi-donor, multi-species query to predict pancreatic cell types, (2) localizing query cells along a developmental trajectory of human fetal liver hematopoiesis, and (3) inferring surface protein expression with a multimodal CITE-seq atlas of memory T cells.	310	0.8487337440109514	8	59	6	0.01935483870967742	51.68

Identifying these top principal components typically focuses on the total variance explained, and principal components that explain small clusters from rare populations will not necessarily capture a large percentage of variance in the data. We present a computationally efficient alternative for identifying the optimal principal components based on the tails of the distribution of variance explained for each observation. We then evaluate the efficacy of our approach in three different single cell RNA-sequencing data sets and find that our method matches, or outperforms, other selection criteria that are typically employed in the literature.pcqc is written in Python and available at github.com/RoussosLab/pcqc	310	0.8487337440109514	3	19	0	0	10.58

However, the spatial code embedded in the molecular interactions driving and sustaining spatial organization remains to be elucidated. Here we present a computational framework to infer the spatial code underlying cell-cell interactions in a whole animal. Using the transcriptomes of the cell types composing Caenorhabditis elegans’ body, we compute the potential for intercellular interactions from the coexpression of ligand-receptor pairs. Leveraging a 3D atlas of C. elegans’ cells and a genetic algorithm we identify the ligand-receptor pairs most informative of the spatial organization of cells. The resulting intercellular distances are negatively correlated with the potential for cell-cell interaction, validating this strategy. Further, for selected ligand-receptor pairs, we experimentally confirm the algorithm-generated cell-cell interactions. Thus, our computational framework helps identify a code associated with spatial organization and cellular functions across a whole-animal body, showing that single-cell molecular measurements provide spatial information that may help elucidate organismal phenotypes and disease.-A cell-cell interaction network in the whole body of C. elegans is presented.-Intercellular distance and interactions are negatively correlated.-A combination of ligand-receptor pairs carries a spatial code of cell-cell interactions.-Spatial expression of specific ligand-receptor pairs is validated in vivo.	308	0.8432580424366872	9	80	3	0.00974025974025974	30.4
10.1101/2020.11.23.390682	FALSE	TRUE	Maximizing statistical power to detect clinically associated cell states with scPOST	2020-11-23	As advances in single-cell technologies enable the unbiased assay of thousands of cells simultaneously, human disease studies are able to identify clinically associated cell states using case-control study designs. These studies require precious clinical samples and costly technologies; therefore, it is critical to employ study design principles that maximize power to detect cell state frequency shifts between conditions, such as disease versus healthy. Here, we present single-cell Power Simulation Tool (scPOST), a method that enables users to estimate power under different study designs. To approximate the specific experimental and clinical scenarios being investigated, scPOST takes prototype (public or pilot) single-cell data as input and generates large numbers of single-cell datasets in silico. We use scPOST to perform power analyses on three independent single-cell datasets that span diverse experimental conditions: a batch-corrected 21-sample rheumatoid arthritis dataset (5,265 cells) from synovial tissue, a 259-sample tuberculosis progression dataset (496,517 memory T cells) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and a 30-sample ulcerative colitis dataset (235,229 cells) from intestinal biopsies. Over thousands of simulations, we consistently observe that power to detect frequency shifts in cell states is maximized by larger numbers of independent clinical samples, reduced batch effects, and smaller variation in a cell state’s frequency across samples.	307	0.840520191649555	7	36	1	0.003257328990228013	19.73
10.1101/2020.11.23.393769	FALSE	TRUE	Milo: differential abundance testing on single-cell data using k-NN graphs	2020-11-23	Single-cell omic protocols applied to disease, development or mechanistic studies can reveal the emergence of aberrant cell states or changes in differentiation. These perturbations can manifest as a shift in the abundance of cells associated with a biological condition. Current computational workflows for comparative analyses typically use discrete clusters as input when testing for differential abundance between experimental conditions. However, clusters are not always an optimal representation of the biological manifold on which cells lie, especially in the context of continuous differentiation trajectories. To overcome these barriers to discovery, we present Milo, a flexible and scalable statistical framework that performs differential abundance testing by assigning cells to partially overlapping neighbourhoods on a k-nearest neighbour graph. Our method samples and refines neighbourhoods across the graph and leverages the flexibility of generalized linear models, making it applicable to a wide range of experimental settings. Using simulations, we show that Milo is both robust and sensitive, and can reveal subtle but important cell state perturbations that are obscured by discretizing cells into clusters. We illustrate the power of Milo by identifying the perturbed differentiation during ageing of a lineage-biased thymic epithelial precursor state and by uncovering extensive perturbation to multiple lineages in human cirrhotic liver.

However, clustering has an innate uncertainty and can be imperfect, undermining the reliability of differential expression analysis results. To overcome this challenge, we present MarcoPolo, a clustering-free approach to exploring differentially expressed genes. To find informative genes without clustering, MarcoPolo exploits the bimodality of gene expression to learn the group information of the cells with respect to the expression level directly from given data. Using simulations and real data analyses, we showed that our method puts biologically informative genes at high ranks more robustly than other existing methods. As our method provides information on how cells can be grouped for each gene, it can help identify cell types that are not separated well in the standard clustering process. Our method can also be used as a feature selection method to improve the robustness of the dimension reduction against changes in the parameters involved in the process.	307	0.840520191649555	5	28	0	0	14.83

High-throughput single-cell data reveal an unprecedented view of cell identity and allow complex variations between conditions to be discovered; nonetheless, most methods for differential expression target differences in the mean and struggle to identify changes where the mean is only marginally affected. distinct is based on a hierarchical non-parametric permutation approach and, by comparing empirical cumulative distribution functions, identifies both differential patterns involving changes in the mean, as well as more subtle variations that do not involve the mean. We performed extensive benchmarks across both simulated and experimental datasets from single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry data, where distinct shows favourable performance, identifies more differential patterns than competitors, and displays good control of false positive and false discovery rates. distinct is available as a Bioconductor R package.	305	0.8350444900752909	5	30	1	0.003278688524590164	34.88

Molecular features such as genes and proteins defining RCPs are often unknown and difficult to detect from unenriched single-cell data, using conventional dimensionality reduction and clustering-based approaches.Here, we propose a novel unsupervised approach, named SCMER, which performs UMAP style dimensionality reduction via selecting a compact set of molecular features with definitive meanings.We applied SCMER in the context of hematopoiesis, lymphogenesis, tumorigenesis, and drug resistance and response. We found that SCMER can identify non-redundant features that sensitively delineate both common cell lineages and rare cellular states ignored by current approaches.SCMER can be widely used for discovering novel molecular features in a high dimensional dataset, designing targeted, cost-effective assays for clinical applications, and facilitating multi-modality integration.	298	0.8158795345653662	9	70	1	0.003355704697986577	13.93
10.1101/2020.12.04.412247	FALSE	TRUE	A Universal Deep Neural Network for In-Depth Cleaning of Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data	2020-12-06	Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has been widely used in biomedical research and generated enormous volume and diversity of data. The raw data contain multiple types of noise and technical artifacts and need thorough cleaning. The existing denoising and imputation methods largely focus on a single type of noise (i.e. dropouts) and have strong distribution assumptions which greatly limit their performance and application. We designed and developed the AutoClass model, integrating two deep neural network components, an autoencoder and a classifier, as to maximize both noise removal and signal retention. AutoClass is free of distribution assumptions, hence can effectively clean a wide range of noises and artifacts. AutoClass outperforms the state-of-art methods in multiple types of scRNA-Seq data analyses, including data recovery, differential expression analysis, clustering analysis and batch effect removal. Importantly, AutoClass is robust on key hyperparameter settings including bottleneck layer size, pre-clustering number and classifier weight.

10.1101/2020.12.08.417105	FALSE	TRUE	constclust: Consistent Clusters for scRNA-seq	2020-12-09	1Unsupervised clustering to identify distinct cell types is a crucial step in the analysis of scRNA-seq data. Current clustering methods are dependent on a number of parameters whose effect on the resulting solution’s accuracy and reproducibility are poorly understood. The adjustment of clustering parameters is therefore ad-hoc, with most users deviating minimally from default settings. constclust is a novel meta-clustering method based on the idea that if the data contains distinct populations which a clustering method can identify, meaningful clusters should be robust to small changes in the parameters used to derive them. By reconciling solutions from a clustering method over multiple parameters, we can identify locally robust clusters of cells and their corresponding regions of parameter space. Rather than assigning cells to a single partition of the data set, this approach allows for discovery of discrete groups of cells which can correspond to the multiple levels of cellular identity. Additionally constclust requires significantly fewer computational resources than current consensus clustering methods for scRNA-seq data. We demonstrate the utility, accuracy, and performance of constclust as part of the analysis workflow. constclust is available at https://github.com/ivirshup/constclust1.	291	0.7967145790554415	4	42	0	0	20.88

While there are various tools and methods to perform data integration and correct for batch effects, their performance can vary between datasets and according to the nature of the bias. Therefore, it is important to understand how batch effects manifest in order to adjust for them in a reliable way. Here, we systematically explore batch effects in a variety of scRNA-seq datasets according to magnitude, cell type specificity and complexity.We developed a cell-specific mixing score (cms) that quantifies how well cells from multiple batches are mixed. By considering distance distributions (in a lower dimensional space), the score is able to detect local batch bias and differentiate between unbalanced batches (i.e., when one cell type is more abundant in a batch) and systematic differences between cells of the same cell type. We implemented cms and related metrics to detect batch effects or measure structure preservation in the CellMixS R/Bioconductor package.We systematically compare different metrics that have been proposed to quantify batch effects or bias in scRNA-seq data using real datasets with known batch effects and synthetic data that mimic various real data scenarios. While these metrics target the same question and are used interchangeably, we find differences in inter- and intra-dataset scalability, sensitivity and in a metric’s ability to handle batch effects with differentially abundant cell types. We find that cell-specific metrics outperform cell type-specific and global metrics and recommend them for both method benchmarks and batch exploration.	289	0.7912388774811773	8	39	1	0.0034602076124567475	19.75
10.1101/2020.12.11.422014	FALSE	TRUE	Unbiased integration of single cell multi-omics data	2020-12-11	Acquiring accurate single-cell multiomics profiles often requires performing unbiased in silico integration of data matrices generated by different single-cell technologies from the same biological sample. However, both the rows and the columns can represent different entities in different data matrices, making such integration a computational challenge that has only been solved approximately by existing approaches. Here, we present bindSC, a single-cell data integration tool that realizes simultaneous alignment of the rows and the columns between data matrices without making approximations. Using datasets produced by multiomics technologies as gold standard, we show that bindSC generates accurate multimodal co-embeddings that are substantially more accurate than those generated by existing approaches. Particularly, bindSC effectively integrated single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scATAC-seq) data towards discovering key regulatory elements in cancer cell-lines and mouse cells. It achieved accurate integration of both common and rare cell types (&lt;0.25% abundance) in a novel mouse retina cell atlas generated using the 10x Genomics Multiome ATAC+RNA kit. Further, it achieves unbiased integration of scRNA-seq and 10x Visium spatial transcriptomics data derived from mouse brain cortex samples. Lastly, it demonstrated efficacy in delineating immune cell types via integrating single-cell RNA and protein data. Thus, bindSC, available at https://github.com/KChen-lab/bindSC, can be applied in a broad variety of context to accelerate discovery of complex cellular and biological identities and associated molecular underpinnings in diseases and developing organisms.	289	0.7912388774811773	10	57	1	0.0034602076124567475	27.93

One of the main challenges in the post-GWAS era is to understand the causality of the genetic variants. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis has been proven to be an effective way to address this question by examining the relationship between gene expression and genetic variation in a sufficiently powered cohort. However, it is often tricky to determine the sample size at which a variant with a specific allele frequency will be detected to associate with gene expression with sufficient power. This is particularly demanding with single-cell RNAseq studies. Therefore, a user-friendly tool to perform power analysis for eQTL at both bulk tissue and single-cell level will be critical. Here, we presented an R package called powerEQTL with flexible functions to calculate power, minimal sample size, or detectable minor allele frequency in both bulk tissue and single-cell eQTL analysis.

However, conventional distance metrics, such as Euclidean, Pearson, and Spearman distances, fail to simultaneously take into account the high dimensionality, monotonicity, and magnitude of gene expression data. To address several shortcomings in these commonly used metrics, we present a magnitude-contingent monotonic correlation metric called Polaratio which is designed to enhance the quality of scRNA-seq data analysis.We integrate three interpretable clustering algorithms – Single-Cell Consensus Clustering (SC3), Hierarchical Clustering (HC), and K-Medoids (KM) – through a consensus cell clustering procedure, which we evaluate on various biological datasets to benchmark Polaratio against several well-known metrics.

In general, trajectory and pseudotime inference methods have so far suffered from the ambiguity of the static single-cell transcriptome snapshots lacking a measure of directionality of transcriptional activity. We report Cytopath, a method for trajectory inference that takes advantage of transcriptional activity information from RNA velocity of single cells to perform trajectory inference. Cytopath performs this task by defining a Markov chain model, simulation of an ensemble of possible differentiation trajectories and subsequent statistical analysis to extract the topological and molecular characteristics of the studied differentiation process. We demonstrate the capability of Cytopath to reconstruct differentiation trajectories with varying bifurcated, circular, convergent and mixed topology studied in single-snapshot as well as time-series single-cell RNA sequencing experiments. We demonstrate superior and enabling capability to reconstruct differentiation trajectories in comparison to state-of-the art trajectory inference approaches. Trajectory inference constitutes a frequent step in interpreting single-cell RNA sequencing studies. We expect Cytopath to enable researchers to tap the directionality information present in single-cell RNA sequencing data to achieve trajectory inference for possibly complex lineages at an unprecedented precision and resolution.	278	0.7611225188227242	5	24	1	0.0035971223021582736	9.08

We present SPaRTAN (Single-cell Proteomic and RNA based Transcription factor Activity Network), a computational method to link cell-surface receptors to transcription factors (TFs) by exploiting cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) datasets with cis-regulatory information. SPaRTAN is applied to immune cell types in the blood to predict the coupling of signaling receptors with cell context-specific TFs. The predictions are validated by prior knowledge and flow cytometry analyses. SPaRTAN is then used to predict the signaling coupled TF states of tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells in malignant peritoneal and pleural mesotheliomas. SPaRTAN greatly enhances the utility of CITE-seq datasets to uncover TF and cell-surface receptor relationships in diverse cellular states.Recently single-cell technologies such as CITE-seq have been developed that enable simultaneous quantitative analysis of cell-surface receptor expression with transcriptional states. To date, these datasets have not been used to systematically develop cell-context-specific maps of the interface between signaling and transcriptional regulators orchestrating cellular identity and function. We developed a computational framework, SPaRTAN (Single-cell Proteomic and RNA based Transcription factor Activity Network) that integrates single-cell proteomic and transcriptomic data based on CITE-seq with cis-regulatory information. We applied our method to publicly available (PBMCs) and new CITE-seq datasets (mesothelioma). Our predicted TF activity and cell-surface receptor relationships are validated by prior knowledge as well as experimental testing.

In this paper, we present VITAE, a probabilistic method combining a latent hierarchical mixture model with variational autoencoders to infer trajectories from posterior approximations. VITAE is computationally scalable and can adjust for confounding covariates to integrate multiple datasets. We show that VITAE outperforms other state-of-the-art trajectory inference methods on both real and synthetic data under various trajectory topologies. We also apply VITAE to jointly analyze two single-cell RNA sequencing datasets on mouse neocortex.

Although several computational tissue reconstruction methods using transcriptomic data have been proposed, those methods are insufficient with regard to arranging cells in their correct positions in tissues or organs unless spatial information is explicitly provided. Here, we propose eSPRESSO, a powerful in silico three-dimensional (3D) tissue reconstruction method using stochastic self-organizing map (stochastic-SOM) clustering, together with optimization of gene set by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework, to estimate the spatial domain structure of cells in any topology of tissues or organs from only their transcriptome profiles. We confirmed the performance of eSPRESSO by mouse embryo, embryonic heart, adult cortical layers, and human pancreas organoid with high reproducibility (success rate = 72.5–100%), while discovering morphologically important spatial discriminator genes (SDGs). Furthermore, we applied eSPRESSO to analysis of human adult heart diseases by virtual gene knockouts, and revealed candidate mechanisms of deformation of heart structure. The eSPRESSO may provide novel methods to analyze the mechanisms of 3D structure formation and morphology-based disease mechanisms.	266	0.7282683093771389	8	31	0	0	3.25
10.1101/2021.01.04.425335	FALSE	TRUE	Learning association for single-cell transcriptomics by integrating profiling of gene expression and alternative polyadenylation	2021-01-05	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled transcriptome-wide profiling of gene expressions in individual cells. A myriad of computational methods have been proposed to learn cell-cell similarities and/or cluster cells, however, high variability and dropout rate inherent in scRNA-seq confounds reliable quantification of cell-cell associations based on the gene expression profile alone. Lately bioinformatics studies have emerged to capture key transcriptome information on alternative polyadenylation (APA) from standard scRNA-seq and revealed APA dynamics among cell types, suggesting the possibility of discerning cell identities with the APA profile. Complementary information at both layers of APA isoforms and genes creates great potential to develop cost-efficient approaches to dissect cell types based on multiple modalities derived from existing scRNA-seq data without changing experimental technologies. We proposed a toolkit called scLAPA for learning association for single-cell transcriptomics by combing single-cell profiling of gene expression and alternative polyadenylation derived from the same scRNA-seq data. We compared scLAPA with seven similarity metrics and five clustering methods using diverse scRNA-seq datasets. Comparative results showed that scLAPA is more effective and robust for learning cell-cell similarities and clustering cell types than competing methods. Moreover, with scLAPA we found two hidden subpopulations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells that were undetectable using the gene expression data alone. As a comprehensive toolkit, scLAPA provides a unique strategy to learn cell-cell associations, improve cell type clustering and discover novel cell types by augmentation of gene expression profiles with polyadenylation information, which can be incorporated in most existing scRNA-seq pipelines. scLAPA is available at https://github.com/BMILAB/scLAPA.	264	0.7227926078028748	8	59	0	0	2
10.1101/2021.01.07.425804	FALSE	TRUE	Cancer phylogenetics using single-cell RNA-seq data	2021-01-08	Phylogenetic methods are emerging as an useful tool to understand cancer evolutionary dynamics, including tumor structure, heterogeneity, and progression. Most currently used approaches utilize either bulk whole genome sequencing (WGS) or single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) and are based on calling copy number alterations and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Here we explore the potential of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to reconstruct cancer evolutionary dynamics. scRNA-seq is commonly applied to explore differential gene expression of cancer cells throughout tumor progression. The method exacerbates the single-cell sequencing problem of low yield per cell with uneven expression levels. This accounts for low and uneven sequencing coverage and makes SNV detection and phylogenetic analysis challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time that scRNA-seq data contains sufficient evolutionary signal and can be utilized in phylogenetic analyses. We explore and compare results of such analyses based on both expression levels and SNVs called from our scRNA-seq data. Both techniques are shown to be useful for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships between cells, reflecting the clonal composition of a tumor. Without an explicit error model, standardized expression values appears to be more powerful and informative than the SNV values at a lower computational cost, due to being a by-product of standard expression analysis. Our results suggest that scRNA-seq can be a competitive alternative or useful addition to conventional scDNA-seq phylogenetic reconstruction. Our results open up a new direction of somatic phylogenetics based on scRNA-seq data. Further research is required to refine and improve these approaches to capture the full picture of somatic evolutionary dynamics in cancer.	261	0.7145790554414785	5	99	0	0	10.65

A fundamental step in the analysis of the produced high-dimensional data is their visualization using dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-SNE and UMAP. We introduce j-SNE and j-UMAP as their natural generalizations to the joint visualization of multimodal omics data. Our approach automatically learns the relative contribution of each modality to a concise representation of cellular identity that promotes discriminative features but suppresses noise. On eight datasets, j-SNE and j-UMAP produce unified embeddings that better agree with known cell types and that harmonize RNA and protein velocity landscapes. j-SNE and j-UMAP are available in the JVis Python package.	259	0.7091033538672142	2	23	1	0.003861003861003861	12.85

Recent computational methods that build upon single-cell sequencing technology, such as trajectory inference or RNA-velocity estimation, provide a way for researchers to analyze the state of each cell during a continuous dynamic process. However, with the surge of such computational methods, there is still a lack of simulators that can model the cell temporal dynamics, and provide ground truth data to benchmark the computational methods.Hereby we present VeloSim, a simulation software that can simulate the gene-expression kinetics in cells along continuous trajectories. VeloSim is able to take any trajectory structure composed of basic elements including “linear” and “cycle” as input, and outputs unspliced mRNA count matrix, spliced mRNA count matrix, cell pseudo-time and true RNA velocity of the cells. We demonstrate how VeloSim can be used to benchmark trajectory inference and RNA-velocity estimation methods with different amounts of biological and technical variation within the datasets.

To characterise the systemic host immune response to SARS-CoV-2, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing coupled with analysis of cell surface proteins, providing molecular profiling of over 800,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a cohort of 130 patients with COVID-19. Our cohort, from three UK centres, spans the spectrum of clinical presentations and disease severities ranging from asymptomatic to critical. Three control groups were included: healthy volunteers, patients suffering from a non-COVID-19 severe respiratory illness and healthy individuals administered with intravenous lipopolysaccharide to model an acute inflammatory response. Full single cell transcriptomes coupled with quantification of 188 cell surface proteins, and T and B lymphocyte antigen receptor repertoires have provided several insights into COVID-19: 1. a new non-classical monocyte state that sequesters platelets and replenishes the alveolar macrophage pool; 2. platelet activation accompanied by early priming towards megakaryopoiesis in immature haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and expansion of megakaryocyte-primed progenitors; 3. increased clonally expanded CD8+ effector:effector memory T cells, and proliferating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in patients with more severe disease; and 4. relative increase of IgA plasmablasts in asymptomatic stages that switches to expansion of IgG plasmablasts and plasma cells, accompanied with higher incidence of BCR sharing, as disease severity increases. All data and analysis results are available for interrogation and data mining through an intuitive web portal. Together, these data detail the cellular processes present in peripheral blood during an acute immune response to COVID-19, and serve as a template for multi-omic single cell data integration across multiple centers to rapidly build powerful resources to help combat diseases such as COVID-19.	254	0.6954140999315537	69	73	5	0.01968503937007874	45.7

However, large-scale integrative analysis of scRNA-seq data remains a challenge largely due to unwanted batch effects and the limited transferabilty, interpretability, and scalability of the existing computational methods. We present single-cell Embedded Topic Model (scETM). Our key contribution is the utilization of a transferable neural-network-based encoder while having an interpretable linear decoder via a matrix tri-factorization. In particular, scETM simultaneously learns an encoder network to infer cell type mixture and a set of highly interpretable gene embeddings, topic embeddings, and batch effect linear intercepts from multiple scRNA-seq datasets. scETM is scalable to over 106 cells and confers remarkable cross-tissue and cross-species zero-shot transfer-learning performance. Using gene set enrichment analysis, we find that scETM-learned topics are enriched in biologically meaningful and disease-related pathways. Lastly, scETM enables the incorporation of known gene sets into the gene embeddings, thereby directly learning the associations between pathways and topics via the topic embeddings.	254	0.6954140999315537	5	100	0	0	13.03

However, to maximize the biological signal robust computational methods are needed to distinguish cell-free from cell-containing droplets. Here, we introduce a novel cell-calling algorithm called EmptyNN, which trains a neural network based on positive-unlabeled learning for improved filtering of barcodes. We leveraged cell hashing and genetic variation to provide ground-truth. EmptyNN accurately removed cell-free droplets while recovering lost cell clusters, and achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) of 94.73% and 96.30%, respectively. The comparisons to current state-of-the-art cell-calling algorithms demonstrated the superior performance of EmptyNN, as measured by the number of recovered cell-containing droplets and cell types. EmptyNN was further applied to two additional datasets and showed good performance. Therefore, EmptyNN represents a powerful tool to enhance scRNA-seq quality control analyses.	252	0.6899383983572895	3	22	0	0	11.75

Such approaches are time-consuming and irreproducible. Therefore, many new supervised methods have been developed to identify cell types for target datasets using the rapid accumulation of public datasets. However, these approaches are sensitive to batch effects or biological variations since the data distributions are different in cross-platforms or species predictions.We developed scAdapt, a virtual adversarial domain adaptation network to transfer cell labels between datasets with batch effects. scAdapt used both the labeled source and unlabeled target data to train an enhanced classifier, and aligned the labeled source centroid and pseudo-labeled target centroid to generate a joint embedding. We demonstrate that scAdapt outperforms existing methods for classification in simulated, cross-platforms, cross-species, and spatial transcriptomic datasets.

On published data, SCA enables recovery of known cell types, both rare and common, with accuracy superior to existing methods. Furthermore, SCA reveals small and subtle subpopulations in complex tissues, including gamma-delta and MAIT cells among cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, which are invisible to existing pipelines. In addition to dimensionality reduction, we leverage SCA’s information-theoretic framework on multi-batched data to separate biological signal from systemic batch effects, achieving robust, interpretable, and state-of-the-art batch correction.

While each single-modality assay reveals distinctive features about the sequenced cells, true multi-omics assays are still in early stage of development. This notion signifies the importance of computationally integrating single-cell omics data that are conducted on various samples across various modalities. In addition, the advent of multiplexed molecular imaging assays has given rise to a need for computational methods for integrative analysis of single-cell imaging and omics data. Here, we present GLUER (inteGrative anaLysis of mUlti-omics at single-cEll Resolution), a flexible tool for integration of single-cell multi-omics data and imaging data. Using multiple true multi-omics data sets as the ground truth, we demonstrate that GLUER achieved significant improvement over existing methods in terms of the accuracy of matching cells across different data modalities resulting in ameliorating downstream analyses such as clustering and trajectory inference. We further demonstrate the broad utility of GLUER for integrating single-cell transcriptomics data with imaging-based spatial proteomics and transcriptomics data. Finally, we extend GLUER to leverage true cell-pair labels when available in true multi-omics data, and show that this approach improves co-embedding and clustering results. With the rapid accumulation of single-cell multi-omics and imaging data, integrated data holds the promise of furthering our understanding of the role of heterogeneity in development and disease.	243	0.6652977412731006	3	26	3	0.012345679012345678	28.88

RNA velocity analysis can infer cell state changes from single cell transcriptomics data. To interpret these cell state changes as part of underlying cellular trajectories, current approaches rely on visualization with principal components, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, and other 2D embeddings derived from the observed single cell transcriptional states. However, these 2D embeddings can yield different representations of the underlying cellular trajectories, hindering the interpretation of cell state changes. We developed VeloViz to create RNA-velocity-informed 2D and 3D embeddings from single cell transcriptomics data. Using both real and simulated data, we demonstrate that VeloViz embeddings are able to consistently capture underlying cellular trajectories across diverse trajectory topologies, even when intermediate cell states may be missing. By taking into consideration the predicted future transcriptional states from RNA velocity analysis, VeloViz can help visualize a more reliable representation of underlying cellular trajectories.

Here, we present a deep clustering algorithm that learns discriminative representation for single-cell data via maximizing mutual information, SMILE (Single-cell Mutual Information Learning). Using a unique cell-pairing design, SMILE successfully integrates multi-source single-cell transcriptome data, removing batch effects and projecting similar cell types, even from different tissues, into the same representation space. SMILE can also integrate data from two or more modalities, such as joint profiling technologies using singlecell ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, DNA methylation, Hi-C, and ChIP data.

To provide interpretable results, methods have incorporated biological priors directly into the learning task; one such biological prior is pathway structure. While pathways represent most biological processes in the cell, the high level of correlation and hierarchical structure make it complicated to determine an appropriate computational representation.Here, we present pathway module Variational Autoencoder (pmVAE). Our method encodes pathway information by restricting the structure of our VAE to mirror gene-pathway memberships. Its architecture is composed of a set of subnetworks, which we refer to as pathway modules. The subnetworks learn interpretable latent representations by factorizing the latent space according to pathway gene sets. We directly address correlation between pathways by balancing a module-specific local loss and a global reconstruction loss. Furthermore, since many pathways are by nature hierarchical and therefore the product of multiple downstream signals, we model each pathway as a multidimensional vector. Due to their factorization over pathways, the representations allow for easy and interpretable analysis of multiple downstream effects, such as cell type and biological stimulus, within the contexts of each pathway. We compare pmVAE against two other state-of-the-art methods on two single-cell RNA-seq case-control data sets, demonstrating that our pathway representations are both more discriminative and consistent in detecting pathways targeted by a perturbation.https://github.com/ratschlab/pmvae	239	0.6543463381245722	4	56	0	0	16.43

This provides researchers with a tremendous advantage for detecting heterogeneity, delineating cellular maps, or identifying rare subpopulations. However, a critical complication remains the low number of single-cell observations due to limitations by the rarity of a subpopulation, tissue degradation, or cost. This absence of sufficient data may cause inaccuracy or irreproducibility of downstream analysis. In this work, we present ACTIVA (Automated Cell-Type-informed Introspective Variational Autoencoder): a novel framework for generating realistic synthetic data using a single-stream adversarial variational autoencoder conditioned with cell-type information. Within a single framework, ACTIVA can generate data representative of the entire population, or specific subpopulations on demand, as opposed to two separate models (such as scGAN and cscGAN). Data generation and augmentation with ACTIVA can enhance scRNAseq pipelines and analysis, such as benchmarking new algorithms, studying the accuracy of classifiers, and detecting marker genes. ACTIVA will facilitate analysis of smaller datasets, potentially reducing the number of patients and animals necessary in initial studies.We train and evaluate models on multiple public scRNAseq datasets. In comparison to GAN-based models (scGAN and cscGAN), we demonstrate that ACTIVA generates cells that are more realistic and harder for classifiers to identify as synthetic, which also have better pair-wise correlations between genes. We show that data augmentation with ACTIVA significantly improves the classification of rare subtypes (more than 45% improvement compared to not augmenting and 4% better than cscGAN) all while reducing training time by an order of magnitude in comparison to both models.Links to raw, pre- and post-processed data, source code and tutorials are available at https://github.com/SindiLab.Supplementary material can be found as a separate file with the same pre-print submission.	239	0.6543463381245722	5	56	0	0	14.18

We propose differential dropout analysis (DDA) to identify the effects of biological variation in single-cell RNA sequencing data. Using 16 publicly available and simulated datasets, we show that DDA accurately detects biological variation and can assess the relative abundance of transcripts more robustly than methods relying on counts.

Current treatments often yield severe insult to host tissue. It is hypothesized that improved “precision medicine” therapies will target pathogenic cells selectively and thus reduce or eliminate severe side effects, and potentially induce robust immune tolerance3. However, it remains challenging to systematically identify which cellular phenotypes are present in cellular ensembles. Here, we present a novel machine learning approach, Signac, which uses neural networks trained with flow-sorted gene expression data to classify cellular phenotypes in single cell RNA-sequencing data. We demonstrate that Signac accurately classified single cell RNA-sequencing data across diseases, technologies, species and tissues. Then we applied Signac to identify known and novel immune-relevant precision medicine candidate drug targets (n = 12) in rheumatoid arthritis.

10.1101/2021.02.02.429335	FALSE	TRUE	Genotyping Copy Number Alterations from single-cell RNA sequencing	2021-02-03	Cancers are constituted by heterogeneous populations of cells that show complex genotypes and phenotypes which we can read out by sequencing. Many attempts at deciphering the clonal process that drives these populations are focusing on single-cell technologies to resolve genetic and phenotypic intra-tumour heterogeneity. While the ideal technologies for these investigations are multi-omics assays, unfortunately these types of data are still too expensive and have limited scalability. We can resort to single-molecule assays, which are cheaper and scalable, and statistically emulate a joint assay, only if we can integrate measurements collected from independent cells of the same sample. In this work we follow this intuition and construct a new Bayesian method to genotype copy number alterations on single-cell RNA sequencing data, therefore integrating DNA and RNA measurements. Our method is unsupervised, and leverages on a segmentation of the input DNA to determine the sample subclonal composition at the copy number level, together with clone-specific phenotypes defined from RNA counts. By design our probabilistic method works without a reference RNA expression profile, and therefore can be applied in cases where this information may not be accessible. We implement the method on a probabilistic backend that allows easy running on both CPUs and GPUs, and test it on both simulated and real data. Our analysis shows its ability to determine copy number associated clones and their RNA phenotypes in tumour data from 10x and Smart-Seq assays, as well as in data from the Human Cell Atlas project.	235	0.6433949349760438	3	31	0	0	30.38

The existing algorithms struggle to deal with dropouts and cellular heterogeneity, and commonly require pseudotime-ordered cells. Here, we describe DeepDRIM a supervised deep neural network that represents gene pair joint expression as images and considers the neighborhood context to eliminate the transitive interactions. Deep-DRIM yields significantly better performance than the other nine algorithms used on the eight cell lines tested, and can be used to successfully discriminate key functional modules between patients with mild and severe symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).	235	0.6433949349760438	8	62	1	0.00425531914893617	18.926

To resolve this challenge Multi-resolution Reconciled Tree (MRtree), builds a hierarchical tree structure based on multi-resolution partitions that is highly flexible and can be coupled with most scRNA-seq clustering algorithms. MRtree out-performs bottom-up or divisive hierarchical clustering approaches because it inherits the robustness and versatility of a flat clustering approach, while maintaining the hierarchical structure of cells. Application to fetal brain cells yields insight into subtypes of cells that can be reliably estimated.	230	0.6297056810403833	6	22	0	0	10.184
10.1101/2021.02.07.430106	FALSE	TRUE	HGC: fast hierarchical clustering for large-scale single-cell data	2021-02-07	Clustering is a key step in revealing heterogeneities in single-cell data. Cell heterogeneity can be explored at different resolutions and the resulted varying cell states are inherently nested. However, most existing single-cell clustering methods output a fixed number of clusters without the hierarchical information. Classical hierarchical clustering provides dendrogram of cells, but cannot scale to large datasets due to the high computational complexity. We present HGC, a fast Hierarchical Graph-based Clustering method to address both problems. It combines the advantages of graph-based clustering and hierarchical clustering. On the shared nearest neighbor graph of cells, HGC constructs the hierarchical tree with linear time complexity. Experiments showed that HGC enables multiresolution exploration of the biological hierarchy underlying the data, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmark data, and can scale to large datasets.

10.1101/2021.02.09.430550	FALSE	TRUE	scPNMF: sparse gene encoding of single cells to facilitate gene selection for targeted gene profiling	2021-02-10	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) captures whole transcriptome information of individual cells. While scRNA-seq measures thousands of genes, researchers are often interested in only dozens to hundreds of genes for a closer study. Then a question is how to select those informative genes from scRNA-seq data. Moreover, single-cell targeted gene profiling technologies are gaining popularity for their low costs, high sensitivity, and extra (e.g., spatial) information; however, they typically can only measure up to a few hundred genes. Then another challenging question is how to select genes for targeted gene profiling based on existing scRNA-seq data. Here we develop the single-cell Projective Non-negative Matrix Factorization (scPNMF) method to select informative genes from scRNA-seq data in an unsupervised way. Compared with existing gene selection methods, scPNMF has two advantages. First, its selected informative genes can better distinguish cell types. Second, it enables the alignment of new targeted gene profiling data with reference data in a low-dimensional space to facilitate the prediction of cell types in the new data. Technically, scPNMF modifies the PNMF algorithm for gene selection by changing the initialization and adding a basis selection step, which selects informative bases to distinguish cell types. We demonstrate that scPNMF outperforms the state-of-the-art gene selection methods on diverse scRNA-seq datasets. Moreover, we show that scPNMF can guide the design of targeted gene profiling experiments and cell-type annotation on targeted gene profiling data.	228	0.6242299794661191	5	47	0	0	1

Recovering dropout events in a sparse gene expression matrix for scRNA-seq data is a long-standing matrix completion problem. We introduce Bfimpute, a Bayesian factorization imputation algorithm that reconstructs two latent gene and cell matrices to impute final gene expression matrix within each cell group, with or without the aid of cell type labels or bulk data. Bfimpute achieves better accuracy than other six publicly notable scRNA-seq imputation methods on simulated and real scRNA-seq data, as measured by several different evaluation metrics. Bfimpute can also flexibly integrate any gene or cell related information that users provide to increase the performance.

However, accurate prediction of cell fates, and thereby biologically meaningful discovery, is challenged by the sheer size of single-cell data, the diversity of omic data types, and the complexity of their topologies. We present VIA, a scalable trajectory inference algorithm that overcomes these limitations by using lazy-teleporting random walks to accurately reconstruct complex cellular trajectories beyond tree-like pathways (e.g. cyclic or disconnected structures). We show that VIA robustly and efficiently unravels the fine-grained sub-trajectories in a 1.3-million-cell transcriptomic mouse atlas without losing the global connectivity at such a high cell count. We further apply VIA to discovering elusive lineages and less populous cell fates missed by other methods across a variety of data types, including single-cell proteomic, epigenomic, multi-omics datasets, and a new in-house single-cell morphological dataset.	227	0.621492128678987	5	67	0	0	47.6

Triku is a feature selection method that favours genes defining the main cell populations. It does so by selecting genes expressed by groups of cells that are close in the nearest neighbor graph. Triku efficiently recovers cell populations present in artificial and biological benchmarking datasets, based on mutual information and silhouette coefficient measurements. Additionally, gene sets selected by triku are more likely to be related to relevant Gene Ontology terms, and contain fewer ribosomal and mitochondrial genes.

In addition to the clonal-tree, PhylEx also assigns single-cells to clones, which effectively produce clonal expression profiles, and generates clonal genotypes. By analyzing scRNA-seq integrated with bulk DNA-seq, PhylEx can take advantage of co-occurrences of the mutations found in the cells. In the probabilistic model underlying PhylEx, the raw read counts from scRNA-seq follow a mixture of Beta-Binomial distributions, which accounts for the sparse nature of single-cell gene expression data; the mixture lessens the penalty caused by mutations not observed due to mono-allelic expression. We rigorously evaluated PhylEx on simulated datasets as well as a biological dataset consisting of a previously well-characterized high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cell line. PhylEx outperformed the state-of-the-art methods by a wide margin both when comparing capacity for clonal-tree reconstruction and capacity for correctly clustering mutations. By analyzing HGSOC and HER2+ breast cancer data, we also show that PhylEx clears the way for phylo-phenotypic analysis of cancer, i.e., that the clonal expression profiles, induced by the cell-to-clone assignments, can be exploited in a manner beyond what is possible with only expression-based clustering.	221	0.6050650239561944	12	36	0	0	8.83

However, preserving topological structure among cells to low dimensional space remains a challenge. Here, we present the single-cell graph autoencoder (scGAE), a dimensionality reduction method that preserves topological structure in scRNA-seq data. scGAE builds a cell graph and uses a multitask-oriented graph autoencoder to preserve topological structure information and feature information in scRNA-seq data simultaneously. We further extended scGAE for scRNA-seq data visualization, clustering, and trajectory inference. Analyses of simulated data showed that scGAE accurately reconstructs developmental trajectory and separates discrete cell clusters under different scenarios, outperforming recently developed deep learning methods. Furthermore, implementation of scGAE on empirical data showed scGAE provided novel insights into cell developmental lineages and preserved inter-cluster distances.	221	0.6050650239561944	4	40	1	0.004524886877828055	11.68

We introduce MultiMAP, an approach for dimensionality reduction and integration of multiple datasets. MultiMAP recovers a single manifold on which all of the data resides and then projects the data into a single low-dimensional space so as to preserve the structure of the manifold. It is based on a framework of Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology, and generalizes the popular UMAP algorithm1 to the multimodal setting. MultiMAP can be used for visualization of multimodal data, and as an integration approach that enables joint analyses. MultiMAP has several advantages over existing integration strategies for single-cell data, including that MultiMAP can integrate any number of datasets, leverages features that are not present in all datasets (i.e. datasets can be of different dimensionalities), is not restricted to a linear mapping, can control the influence of each dataset on the embedding, and is extremely scalable to large datasets. We apply MultiMAP to the integration of a variety of single-cell transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility, methylation, and spatial data, and show that it outperforms current approaches in preservation of high-dimensional structure, alignment of datasets, visual separation of clusters, transfer learning, and runtime. On a newly generated single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) dataset of the human thymus, we use MultiMAP to integrate cells along a temporal trajectory. This enables the quantitative comparison of transcription factor expression and binding site accessibility over the course of T cell differentiation, revealing patterns of transcription factor kinetics.	221	0.6050650239561944	13	48	0	0	16.63

Though clustering of cellular transcriptomes is the default technique for defining cell types and subtypes, single cell clustering can be strongly influenced by technical variation. In fact, the prevalent unsupervised clustering algorithms can cluster cells by technical, rather than biological, variation.Compared to de novo (unsupervised) clustering methods, we demonstrate using multiple benchmarks that supervised clustering, which uses reference transcriptomes as a guide, is robust to batch effects. To leverage the advantages of supervised clustering, we present RCA2, a new, scalable, and broadly applicable version of our RCA algorithm. RCA2 provides a user-friendly framework for supervised clustering and downstream analysis of large scRNA-seq data sets. RCA2 can be seamlessly incorporated into existing algorithmic pipelines. It incorporates various new reference panels for human and mouse, supports generation of custom panels and uses efficient graph-based clustering and sparse data structures to ensure scalability. We demonstrate the applicability of RCA2 on SC data from human bone marrow, healthy PBMCs and PBMCs from COVID-19 patients. Importantly, RCA2 facilitates cell-type-specific QC, which we show is essential for accurate clustering of SC data from heterogeneous tissues. In the era of cohort-scale SC analysis, supervised clustering methods such as RCA2 will facilitate unified analysis of diverse SC datasets.RCA2 is implemented in R and is available at github.com/prabhakarlab/RCAv2	221	0.6050650239561944	12	40	0	0	10.75

These datasets, including scRNA-seq data, scATAC-seq data and sc-methylation data, usually have different powers in identifying the unknown cell types through clustering. So, methods that integrate multiple datasets can potentially lead to a better clustering performance. Here we propose coupleCoC+ for the integrative analysis of single-cell genomic data. coupleCoC+ is a transfer learning method based on the information-theoretic co-clustering framework. In coupleCoC+, we utilize the information in one dataset, the source data, to facilitate the analysis of another dataset, the target data. coupleCoC+ uses the linked features in the two datasets for effective knowledge transfer, and it also uses the information of the features in the target data that are unlinked with the source data. In addition, coupleCoC+ matches similar cell types across the source data and the target data. By applying coupleCoC+ to the integrative clustering of mouse cortex scATAC-seq data and scRNA-seq data, mouse and human scRNA-seq data, mouse cortex sc-methylation and scRNA-seq data, and human blood dendritic cells scRNA-seq data from two batches, we demonstrate that coupleCoC+ improves the overall clustering performance and matches the cell subpopulations across multimodal single-cell genomic datasets. coupleCoC+ has fast convergence and it is computationally efficient.

However, currently, it is challenging to infer the joint representations and learn relationships among multiple modalities from complex multimodal single-cell data. Herein, we present scMM, a novel deep generative model-based framework for the extraction of interpretable joint representations and cross-modal generation. scMM addresses the complexity of data by leveraging a mixture-of-experts multimodal variational autoencoder. The pseudocell generation strategy of scMM compensates for the limited interpretability of deep learning models and discovered multimodal regulatory programs associated with latent dimensions. Analysis of recently produced datasets validated that scMM facilitates high-resolution clustering with rich interpretability. Furthermore, we show that cross-modal generation by scMM leads to more precise prediction and data integration compared with the state-of-the-art and conventional approaches.	219	0.5995893223819302	5	35	1	0.0045662100456621	11.83

The problem of inferring cell trajectories from single-cell measurements has been a major topic in the single-cell analysis community, with different methods developed for equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems (e.g. haematopoeisis vs. embryonic development). We show that optimal transport analysis, a technique originally designed for analysing time-courses, may also be applied to infer cellular trajectories from a single snapshot of a population in equilibrium. Therefore optimal transport provides a unified approach to inferring trajectories, applicable to both stationary and non-stationary systems. Our method, StationaryOT, is mathematically motivated in a natural way from the hypothesis of a Waddington’s epigenetic landscape. We implemented StationaryOT as a software package and demonstrate its efficacy when applied to simulated data as well as single-cell data from Arabidopsis thaliana root development.	208	0.5694729637234771	5	43	1	0.004807692307692308	2.75

An important preprocessing step prior to performing downstream analyses is to identify and remove cells with poor or degraded sample quality using quality control (QC) metrics. Two widely used QC metrics to identify a ‘low-quality’ cell are (i) if the cell includes a high proportion of reads that map to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded genes and (ii) if a small number of genes are detected. Current best practices use these QC metrics independently with either arbitrary, uniform thresholds (e.g. 5%) or biological context-dependent (e.g. species) thresholds, and fail to jointly model these metrics in a data-driven manner. Current practices are often overly stringent and especially untenable on lower-quality tissues, such as archived tumor tissues.We propose a data-driven QC metric (miQC) that jointly models both the proportion of reads mapping to mtDNA genes and the number of detected genes with mixture models in a probabilistic framework to predict the low-quality cells in a given dataset. We demonstrate how our QC metric easily adapts to different types of single-cell datasets to remove low-quality cells while preserving high-quality cells that can be used for downstream analyses.Software available at https://github.com/greenelab/miQC.

To investigate cells with transient properties or mixed identities, we present MuTrans, a method based on multiscale reduction technique for the underlying stochastic dynamical systems that prescribes cell-fate transitions. By iteratively unifying transition dynamics across multiple scales, MuTrans constructs the cell-fate dynamical manifold that depicts progression of cell-state transition, and distinguishes meta-stable and transition cells. In addition, MuTrans quantifies the likelihood of all possible transition trajectories between cell states using the coarse-grained transition path theory. Downstream analysis identifies distinct genes that mark the transient states or drive the transitions. Mathematical analysis reveals consistency of the method with the well-established Langevin equation and transition rate theory. Applying MuTrans to datasets collected from five different single-cell experimental platforms and benchmarking with seven existing tools, we show its capability and scalability to robustly unravel complex cell fate dynamics induced by transition cells in systems such as tumor EMT, iPSC differentiation and blood cell differentiation. Overall, our method bridges data-driven and model-based approaches on cell-fate transitions at single-cell resolution.	202	0.5530458590006845	4	53	2	0.009900990099009901	9.33

In such dynamic biological systems, grouping cells into discrete groups is not reflective of the biology. Cellular states rather form a continuum, e.g., for the differentiation of stem cells into mature cell types. This process is often represented via a trajectory in a reduced-dimensional representation of the scRNA-seq dataset.While many methods have been suggested for trajectory inference, it is often unclear how to handle multiple biological groups or conditions, e.g., inferring and comparing the differentiation trajectories of wild-type and knock-out stem cell populations.In this manuscript, we present a method for the estimation and downstream interpretation of cell trajectories across multiple conditions. Our framework allows the interpretation of differences between conditions at the trajectory, cell population, and gene expression levels. We start by integrating datasets from multiple conditions into a single trajectory. By comparing the conditions along the trajectory’s path, we can detect large-scale changes, indicative of differential progression. We also demonstrate how to detect subtler changes by finding genes that exhibit different behaviors between these conditions along a differentiation path.	200	0.5475701574264202	4	39	1	0.005	17.65

The reconstruction of a gene network based on coexpression patterns is a fundamental task in scRNA-seq analyses, and the mutual exclusivity of gene expression can be critical for understanding such heterogeneity. Here, we propose an approach for detecting communities from a genetic network constructed on the basis of coexpression properties. The community-based comparison of multiple coexpression networks enables the identification of functionally related gene clusters that cannot be fully captured through differential gene expression-based analysis. We also developed a novel metric referred to as the exclusively expressed index (EEI) that identifies mutually exclusive gene pairs from sparse scRNA-seq data. EEI quantifies and ranks the exclusive expression levels of all gene pairs from binary expression patterns while maintaining robustness against a low sequencing depth. We applied our methods to glioblastoma scRNA-seq data and found that gene communities were partially conserved after serum stimulation despite a considerable number of differentially expressed genes. We also demonstrate that the identification of mutually exclusive gene sets with EEI can improve the sensitivity of capturing cellular heterogeneity. Our methods complement existing approaches and provide new biological insights, even for a large, sparse dataset, in the single-cell analysis field.	194	0.5311430527036276	7	62	0	0	9.2

Quantified alternative PAS transcripts refine cell identities, enriching information extracted from scRNA-seq.	191	0.5229295003422314	5	37	1	0.005235602094240838	2
10.1101/2021.03.17.435887	FALSE	TRUE	Cell cycle gene regulation dynamics revealed by RNA velocity and deep-learning	2021-03-19	The cell cycle is a fundamental process of life, however, a quantitative understanding of gene regulation dynamics in the context of the cell cycle is still far from complete. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology gives access to its dynamics without externally perturbing the cell. Here, we build a high-resolution map of the cell cycle transcriptome based on scRNA-seq and deep-learning. By generating scRNA-seq libraries with high depth, in mouse embryonic stem cells and human fibroblasts, we are able to observe cycling patterns in the unspliced-spliced RNA space for single genes. Since existing methods in scRNA-seq are not efficient to measure cycling gene dynamics, we propose a deep learning approach to fit these cycling patterns sorting single cells across the cell cycle. We characterize the cell cycle in asynchronous pluripotent and differentiated cells identifying major waves of transcription during the G1 phase and systematically study the G1-G0 transition where the cells exit the cycle. Our work presents to the scientific community a broader understanding of RNA velocity and cell cycle maps, that we applied to pluripotency and differentiation. Our approach will facilitate the study of the cell cycle in multiple cellular models and different biological contexts, such as cancer and development.	191	0.5229295003422314	10	77	0	0	37.55
10.1101/2021.03.19.436127	FALSE	TRUE	Representation learning of RNA velocity reveals robust cell transitions	2021-03-20	RNA velocity is a promising technique to reveal transient cellular dynamics among a heterogeneous cell population and quantify their transitions from single-cell transcriptome experiments. However, the cell transitions estimated from high dimensional RNA velocity are often unstable or inaccurate, partly due to the high technical noise and less informative projection. Here, we present VeloAE, a tailored representation learning method to learn a low-dimensional representation of RNA velocity on which cell transitions can be robustly estimated. From various experimental datasets, we show that VeloAE can both accurately identify stimulation dynamics in time-series designs and effectively capture the expected cellular differentiation in different biological systems. VeloAE therefore enhances the usefulness of RNA velocity for studying a wide range of biological processes.	190	0.5201916495550992	2	27	4	0.021052631578947368	34.93

10.1101/2021.03.21.436343	FALSE	TRUE	MAAPER: model-based analysis of alternative polyadenylation using 3’ end-linked reads	2021-03-22	Most eukaryotic genes harbor multiple cleavage and polyadenylation sites (PASs), leading to expression of alternative polyadenylation (APA) isoforms. APA regulation has been implicated in a diverse array of physiological and pathological conditions. While RNA sequencing tools that generate reads containing the PAS, named onSite reads, have been instrumental in identifying PASs, they have not been widely used. By contrast, a growing number of methods generate reads that are close to the PAS, named nearSite reads, including the 3’ end counting strategy commonly used in single cell analysis. How these nearSite reads can be used for APA analysis, however, is poorly studied. Here, we present a computational method, named model-based analysis of alternative polyadenylation using 3’ end-linked reads (MAAPER), to examine APA using nearSite reads. MAAPER uses a probabilistic model to predict PASs for nearSite reads with high accuracy and sensitivity, and examines different types of APA events, including those in 3’UTRs and introns, with robust statistics. We show MAAPER’s accuracy with data from both bulk and single cell RNA samples and its applicability in unpaired or paired experimental designs. Our result also highlights the importance of using well annotated PASs for nearSite read analysis.	188	0.5147159479808351	4	35	0	0	1.5

A typical KO experiment usually involves the phenotypic characterization of KO organisms. The recent advent of single-cell technology has greatly boosted the resolution of cellular phenotyping, providing unprecedented insights into cell-type-specific gene function. However, the use of single-cell technology in large-scale, systematic KO experiments is prohibitive due to the vast resources required. Here we present scTenifoldKnk—a machine learning workflow that performs virtual KO experiments using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. scTenifoldKnk first uses data from wild-type (WT) samples to construct a single-cell gene regulatory network (scGRN). Then, a gene is knocked out from the constructed scGRN by setting weights of the gene’s outward edges to zeros. ScTenifoldKnk then compares this “pseudo-KO” scGRN with the original scGRN to identify differentially regulated (DR) genes. These DR genes, also called virtual-KO perturbed genes, are used to assess the impact of the gene KO and reveal the gene’s function in analyzed cells. Using existing data sets, we demonstrate that the scTenifoldKnk analysis recapitulates the main findings of three real-animal KO experiments and confirms the functions of genes underlying three Mendelian diseases. We show the power of scTenifoldKnk as a predictive method to successfully predict the outcomes of two KO experiments that involve intestinal enterocytes in Ahr-/- mice and pancreatic islet cells in Malat1-/- mice, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate the use of scTenifoldKnk to perform systematic KO analyses, in which a large number of genes are virtually deleted, allowing gene functions to be revealed in a cell type-specific manner.scTenifoldKnk is a machine learning workflow to perform virtual KO experiments using data from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).scTenifoldKnk requires only one input matrix—a gene-by-cell expression matrix obtained by scRNA-seq from wild-type (WT) samples.scTenifoldKnk constructs a single-cell gene regulatory network (scGRN) from scRNA-seq data of the WT sample, and then produces a pseudo-KO scGRN by setting the KO target gene representation in the WT scGRN to zero.scTenifoldKnk compares the WT scGRN and the pseudo-KO scGRN using a quasi-manifold alignment method, to reveal the perturbation effect of gene KO and generate a perturbation profile for the KO gene.Using real-data examples, we show that scTenifoldKnk is a powerful and effective approach for performing virtual KO experiments with scRNA-seq data to elucidate gene function.Gene knockout (KO) experiments are a proven approach for studying gene function. However, large-scale, systematic KO experiments are prohibitive due to the limitation of experimental and animal resources. Here we present scTenifoldKnk—a machine learning workflow for performing virtual KO experiments with data from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We show that the scTenifoldKnk virtual KO analysis recapitulates findings from real-animal KO experiments and can be used to predict outcomes from real-animal KO experiments. scTenifoldKnk is a powerful and efficient virtual KO tool for gene function study, allowing a systematic deletion of a large number of genes individually in scRNA-seq data to reveal individual gene function in a cell type-specific manner.	187	0.5119780971937029	11	95	0	0	10.1
10.1101/2021.03.24.436859	FALSE	TRUE	minicore: Fast scRNA-seq clustering with various distances	2021-03-25	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses typically begin by clustering a gene-by-cell expression matrix to empirically define groups of cells with similar expression profiles. We describe new methods and a new open source library, minicore, for efficient k-means++ center finding and k-means clustering of scRNA-seq data. Minicore works with sparse count data, as it emerges from typical scRNA-seq experiments, as well as with dense data from after dimensionality reduction. Minicore’s novel vectorized weighted reservoir sampling algorithm allows it to find initial k-means++ centers for a 4-million cell dataset in 1.5 minutes using 20 threads. Minicore can cluster using Euclidean distance, but also supports a wider class of measures like Jensen-Shannon Divergence, Kullback-Leibler Divergence, and the Bhattacharyya distance, which can be directly applied to count data and probability distributions.Further, minicore produces lower-cost centerings more efficiently than scikit-learn for scRNA-seq datasets with millions of cells. With careful handling of priors, minicore implements these distance measures with only minor (&lt;2-fold) speed differences among all distances. We show that a minicore pipeline consisting of k-means++, localsearch++ and minibatch k-means can cluster a 4-million cell dataset in minutes, using less than 10GiB of RAM. This memory-efficiency enables atlas-scale clustering on laptops and other commodity hardware. Finally, we report findings on which distance measures give clusterings that are most consistent with known cell type labels.The open source library is at https://github.com/dnbaker/minicore.

Although multiple methods for the computational analysis of scRNA-seq data exist, their application in a clinical setting demands standardized and reproducible workflows, targeted to extract, condense, and display the clinically relevant information. To this end, we designed scAmpi (Single Cell Analysis mRNA pipeline), a workflow that facilitates scRNA-seq analysis from raw read processing to informing on sample composition, clinically relevant gene and pathway alterations, and in silico identification of personalized candidate drug treatments. We demonstrate the value of this workflow for clinical decision making in a molecular tumor board as part of a clinical study.	184	0.5037645448323066	10	21	0	0	4.6

Analyzing the transcriptomes between different projects is highly desirable as this would allow for better assessment of which biological effects are consistent across independent studies. However it is difficult to compare and contrast data across different projects as there are substantial batch effects from computational processing, single cell technology utilized, and the natural biological variation. While many single cell transcriptome specific batch correction methods purport to remove the technical noise it is difficult to ascertain which method functions works best. We developed a lightweight R package (scPOP) that brings in batch integration methods and uses a simple heuristic to balance batch merging and celltype/cluster purity. We use this package along with a Snakefile based workflow system to demonstrate how to optimally merge 766,615 cells from 33 retina datsets and three species to create a massive ocular single cell transcriptome meta-atlas. This provides a model how to efficiently create meta-atlases for tissues and cells of interest.	182	0.49828884325804246	4	67	2	0.01098901098901099	23.9

Identification of novel cell types or transient developmental stages across multiple experimental conditions is one of its key applications. Linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction for data integration became a foundational tool in inference from scRNA-seq data. We present Multi Layer Graph Clustering (MLG) as an integrative approach for combining multiple dimensionality reduction of multi-condition scRNA-seq data. MLG generates a multilayer shared nearest neighbor cell graph with higher signal-to-noise ratio and outperforms current best practices in terms of clustering accuracy across large-scale bench-marking experiments. Application of MLG to a wide variety of datasets from multiple conditions highlights how MLG boosts signal-to-noise ratio for fine-grained sub-population identification.

However, there is a lack of effective computational methods to identify informative mtDNA variants in noisy and sparse single-cell sequencing data. Here we present an open source computational tool MQuad that accurately calls clonally informative mtDNA variants in a population of single cells, and an analysis suite for complete clonality inference, based on single cell RNA or DNA sequencing data. Through a variety of simulated and experimental single cell sequencing data, we showed that MQuad can identify mitochondrial variants with both high sensitivity and specificity, outperforming existing methods by a large extent. Furthermore, we demonstrated its wide applicability in different single cell sequencing protocols, particularly in complementing single-nucleotide and copy-number variations to extract finer clonal resolution.

10.1101/2021.03.28.437378	FALSE	TRUE	Differential expression of single-cell RNA-seq data using Tweedie models	2021-03-29	The performance of computational methods and software to identify differentially expressed genes in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been shown to be influenced by several factors, including the choice of the normalization method used and the choice of the experimental platform (or library preparation protocol) to profile gene expression in individual cells. Currently, it is up to the practitioner to choose the most appropriate differential expression (DE) method out of over 100 DE tools available to date, each relying on their own assumptions to model scRNA-seq data. Here, we propose to use generalized linear models with the Tweedie distribution that can flexibly capture a large dynamic range of observed scRNA-seq data across experimental platforms induced by heavy tails, sparsity, or different count distributions to model the technological variability in scRNA-seq expression profiles. We also propose a zero-inflated Tweedie model that allows zero probability mass to exceed a traditional Tweedie distribution to model zero-inflated scRNA-seq data with excessive zero counts. Using both synthetic and published plate- and droplet-based scRNA-seq datasets, we performed a systematic benchmark evaluation of more than 10 representative DE methods and demonstrate that our method (Tweedieverse) outperforms the state-of-the-art DE approaches across experimental platforms in terms of statistical power and false discovery rate control.

Integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell datasets combines complementary information offered by single-omic datasets and can offer deeper insights on complex biological process. Clustering methods that identify the unknown cell types are among the first few steps in the analysis of single-cell datasets, and they are important for downstream analysis built upon the identified cell types.

Herein we describe IQCELL, a platform to infer, simulate, and study executable logical GRNs directly from scRNA-seq data. Such executable GRNs provide an opportunity to inform fundamental hypotheses in developmental programs and help accelerate the design of stem cell-based technologies. We first describe the architecture of IQCELL. Next, we apply IQCELL to a scRNA-seq dataset of early mouse T-cell development and show that it can infer a priori over 75% of causal gene interactions previously reported via decades of research. We will also show that dynamic simulations of the derived GRN qualitatively recapitulate the effects of the known gene perturbations on the T-cell developmental trajectory. IQCELL is applicable to many developmental systems and offers a versatile tool to infer, simulate, and study GRNs in biological systems.

Here we demonstrate single-cell RNA-5′end-sequencing (sc-end5-seq) methods can detect transcribed CREs (tCREs), enabling simultaneous quantification of gene expression and enhancer activities in a single assay at no extra cost. We showed enhancer RNAs can be detected using sc-end5-seq methods with either random or oligo(dT) priming. To analyze tCREs in single cells, we developed SCAFE (Single Cell Analysis of Five-prime Ends) to identify genuine tCREs and analyze their activities (https://github.com/chung-lab/scafe). As compared to accessible CRE (aCRE, based on chromatin accessibility), tCREs are more accurate in predicting CRE interactions by co-activity, more sensitive in detecting shifts in alternative promoter usage and more enriched in diseases heritability. Our results highlight additional dimensions within sc-end5-seq data which can be used for interrogating gene regulation and disease heritability.	175	0.4791238877481177	15	78	0	0	101.75

Single-cell technologies have enabled increasingly precise measurements of the cell cycle both as a biological process of interest and as a possible confounding factor. Despite its importance and conservation, there is no universally applicable approach to infer position in the cell cycle with high-resolution from single-cell RNA-seq data. Here, we present tricycle, an R/Bioconductor package, to address this challenge by leveraging key features of the biology of the cell cycle, the mathematical properties of principal component analysis of periodic functions, and the ubiquitous applicability of transfer learning. We show that tricycle can predict any cell’s position in the cell cycle regardless of the cell type, species of origin, and even sequencing assay. The accuracy of tricycle compares favorably to gold-standard experimental assays which generally require specialized measurements in specifically constructedin vitrosystems. Unlike gold-standard assays, tricycle is easily applicable to any single-cell RNA-seq dataset. Tricycle is highly scalable, universally accurate, and eminently pertinent for atlas-level data.	173	0.4736481861738535	10	41	1	0.005780346820809248	58.85

However, experimental conditions often confound biological variations when comparing data from different samples. For integrative single-cell data analysis, we have developed SCALEX, a deep generative framework that maps cells into a generalized, batch-invariant cell-embedding space. We demonstrate that SCALEX accurately and efficiently integrates heterogenous single-cell data using multiple benchmarks. It outperforms competing methods, especially for datasets with partial overlaps, accurately aligning similar cell populations while retaining true biological differences. We demonstrate the advantages of SCALEX by constructing continuously expandable single-cell atlases for human, mouse, and COVID-19, which were assembled from multiple data sources and can keep growing through the inclusion of new incoming data. Analyses based on these atlases revealed the complex cellular landscapes of human and mouse tissues and identified multiple peripheral immune subtypes associated with COVID-19 disease severity.	171	0.4681724845995893	4	72	0	0	13.68

With the development of single-cell sequencing technologies, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these data sets to uncover biological insights. Here, we developed a domain-adversarial and variational approximation framework, DAVAE, to integrate multiple single-cell data across samples, technologies and modalities without any post hoc data processing. We fit normalized gene expression into a non-linear model, which transforms a latent variable of a lower-dimension into expression space with a non-linear function, a KL regularizier and a domain-adversarial regularizer. Results on five real data integration applications demonstrated the effectiveness and scalability of DAVAE in batch-effect removing, transfer learning, and cell type predictions for multiple single-cell data sets across samples, technologies and modalities.

The evolution of scRNA-seq protocols has led to a dramatic increase of cells throughput, exacerbating many of the computational and statistical issues that previously arose for bulk sequencing. In particular, with scRNA-seq data all the analyses steps, including normalization, have become computationally intensive, both in terms of memory usage and computational time. In this perspective, new accurate methods able to scale efficiently are desirable.Here we proposePsiNorm, a between-sample normalization method based on the power-law Pareto distribution parameter estimate. Here we show that the Pareto distribution well resembles scRNA-seq data, independently of sequencing depths and technology. Motivated by this result, we implementPsiNorm, a simple and highly scalable normalization method. We benchmarkPsiNormwith other seven methods in terms of cluster identification, concordance and computational resources required. We demonstrate thatPsiNormis among the top performing methods showing a good trade-off between accuracy and scalability.

However, the unavoidable biological noise and technical artifacts in scRNA-seq data as well as the high dimensionality of expression vectors make the problem highly challenging. Consequently, although numerous tools have been developed, their accuracy remains to be improved.Here, we introduce a novel clustering algorithm and tool RCSL (Rank Constrained Similarity Learning) to accurately identify various cell types using scRNA-seq data from a complex tissue. RCSL considers both local similarity and global similarity among the cells to discern the subtle differences among cells of the same type as well as larger differences among cells of different types. RCSL uses Spearman’s rank correlations of a cell’s expression vector with those of other cells to measure its global similarity, and adaptively learns neighbour representation of a cell as its local similarity. The overall similarity of a cell to other cells is a linear combination of its global similarity and local similarity. RCSL automatically estimates the number of cell types defined in the similarity matrix, and identifies them by constructing a block-diagonal matrix, such that its distance to the similarity matrix is minimized. Each block-diagonal submatrix is a cell cluster/type, corresponding to a connected component in the cognate similarity graph. When tested on 16 benchmark scRNA-seq datasets in which the cell types are well-annotated, RCSL substantially outperformed six state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness as measured by three metrics.The RCSL algorithm is implemented in R and can be freely downloaded at https://github.com/QinglinMei/RCSL.guojunsdu@gmail.com, zcsu@uncc.eduSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	165	0.4517453798767967	3	58	0	0	9.58

However, effectively leveraging information from these atlases, such as clustering labels or cell type annotations, remains challenging due to substantial technical noise and sparsity in scRNA-seq measurements. To address this problem, we present HD-AE, a deep autoencoder designed to extract integrated low-dimensional representations of scRNA-seq measurements across datasets from different labs and experimental conditions (https://github.com/suinleelab/HD-AE). Unlike previous approaches, HD-AE’s representations successfully transfer to new query datasets without needing to retrain the model. Researchers without substantial computational resources or machine learning expertise can thus leverage the robust representations learned by pretrained HD-AE models to compare embeddings of their own data with previously generated sets of reference embeddings.	165	0.4517453798767967	2	21	0	0	19.83
10.1101/2021.04.14.439903	FALSE	TRUE	Compositional perturbation autoencoder for single-cell response modeling	2021-04-15	Recent advances in multiplexing single-cell transcriptomics across experiments are enabling the high-throughput study of drug and genetic perturbations. However, an exhaustive exploration of the combinatorial perturbation space is experimentally unfeasible, so computational methods are needed to predict, interpret and prioritize perturbations. Here, we present the Compositional Perturbation Autoencoder (CPA), which combines the interpretability of linear models with the flexibility of deep-learning approaches for single-cell response modeling. CPA encodes and learns transcriptional drug response across different cell types, doses, and drug combinations. The model produces easy-to-interpret embeddings for drugs and cell types, allowing drug similarity analysis and predictions for unseen dosages and drug combinations. We show CPA accurately models single-cell perturbations across compounds, dosages, species, and time. We further demonstrate that CPA predicts combinatorial genetic interactions of several types, implying it captures features that distinguish different interaction programs. Finally, we demonstrate CPA allows in-silico generation of 5,329 missing combinations (97.6% of all possibilities) with diverse genetic interactions. We envision our model will facilitate efficient experimental design by enabling in-silico response prediction at the single-cell level.	164	0.4490075290896646	9	50	1	0.006097560975609756	89.18

Single cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq) measures the chromatin accessibility of cells, and computational methods have been proposed to integrate scATAC-seq with single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of cells from the same cell types. This computational task is particularly challenging when the two modalities are not profiled from the same cells. Some existing methods first transform the scATAC-seq data into scRNA-seq data and integrate two scRNA-seq datasets, but how to perform the transformation is still a difficult problem. In addition, most of existing methods to integrate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data focus on preserving distinct cell clusters before and after the integration, and it is not clear whether these methods can preserve the continuous trajectories for cells from continuous development or differentiation processes.We propose scDART (single cell Deep learning model for ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq Trajectory integration), a scalable deep learning framework that embeds the two data modalities of single cells, scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data, into a shared low-dimensional latent space while preserving cell trajectory structures. Furthermore, scDART learns a nonlinear function represented by a neural network encoding the cross-modality relationship simultaneously when learning the latent space representations of the integrated dataset. We test scDART on both real and simulated datasets, and compare it with the state-of-the-art methods. We show that scDART is able to integrate scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data well while preserving the continuous cell trajectories. scDART also predicts scRNA-seq data accurately from the scATAC-seq data using the neural network module that represents cross-modality relationship.https://github.com/PeterZZQ/scDARTxiuwei.zhang@gatech.edu	160	0.4380561259411362	3	30	0	0	18.38
10.1101/2021.04.19.440534	FALSE	TRUE	Axes of inter-sample variability among transcriptional neighborhoods reveal disease associated cell states in single-cell data	2021-04-20	As single-cell datasets grow in sample size, there is a critical need to characterize cell states that vary across samples and associate with sample attributes like clinical phenotypes. Current statistical approaches typically map cells to cell-type clusters and examine sample differences through that lens alone. Here we present covarying neighborhood analysis (CNA), an unbiased method to identify cell populations of interest with greater flexibility and granularity. CNA characterizes dominant axes of variation across samples by identifying groups of very small regions in transcriptional space, termed neighborhoods, that covary in abundance across samples, suggesting shared function or regulation. CNA can then rigorously test for associations between any sample-level attribute and the abundances of these covarying neighborhood groups. We show in simulation that CNA enables more powerful and accurate identification of disease-associated cell states than a cluster-based approach. When applied to published datasets, CNA captures a Notch activation signature in rheumatoid arthritis, redefines monocyte populations expanded in sepsis, and identifies a previously undiscovered T-cell population associated with progression to active tuberculosis.	159	0.4353182751540041	9	25	1	0.006289308176100629	25.55

Here, we undertake the analysis of alternative splicing across numerous diverse murine cell types from two large-scale single-cell datasets—the Tabula Muris and BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network—while accounting for understudied technical artifacts and unannotated isoforms. We find strong and general cell-type-specific alternative splicing, complementary to total gene expression but of similar discriminatory value, and identify a large volume of novel isoforms. We specifically highlight splicing variation across different cell types in primary motor cortex neurons, bone marrow B cells, and various epithelial cells; and show that the implicated transcripts include many genes which do not display total expression differences. To elucidate the regulation of alternative splicing, we build a custom predictive model based on splicing factor activity, recovering several known interactions while generating new hypotheses, including potential regulatory roles for novel alternative splicing events in critical genes including Khdrbs3 and Rbfox1. We make our results available using public interactive browsers to spur further exploration by the community.	152	0.4161533196440794	3	71	1	0.006578947368421052	19.7
10.1101/2021.04.28.441833	FALSE	TRUE	scvi-tools: a library for deep probabilistic analysis of single-cell omics data	2021-04-29	Probabilistic models have provided the underpinnings for state-of-the-art performance in many single-cell omics data analysis tasks, including dimensionality reduction, clustering, differential expression, annotation, removal of unwanted variation, and integration across modalities. Many of the models being deployed are amenable to scalable stochastic inference techniques, and accordingly they are able to process single-cell datasets of realistic and growing sizes. However, the community-wide adoption of probabilistic approaches is hindered by a fractured software ecosystem resulting in an array of packages with distinct, and often complex interfaces. To address this issue, we developed scvi-tools (https://scvi-tools.org), a Python package that implements a variety of leading probabilistic methods. These methods, which cover many fundamental analysis tasks, are accessible through a standardized, easy-to-use interface with direct links to Scanpy, Seurat, and Bioconductor workflows. By standardizing the implementations, we were able to develop and reuse novel functionalities across different models, such as support for complex study designs through nonlinear removal of unwanted variation due to multiple covariates and reference-query integration via scArches. The extensible software building blocks that underlie scvi-tools also enable a developer environment in which new probabilistic models for single cell omics can be efficiently developed, benchmarked, and deployed. We demonstrate this through a code-efficient reimplementation of Stereoscope for deconvolution of spatial transcriptomics profiles. By catering to both the end user and developer audiences, we expect scvi-tools to become an essential software dependency and serve to formulate a community standard for probabilistic modeling of single cell omics.	150	0.4106776180698152	25	109	12	0.08	55

Existing single-cell RNA-sequencing methods suffer from sub-optimal target recovery leading to inaccurate measurements including many false negatives. The resulting ‘zero-inflated’ data may confound data interpretation and visualization.Since cells have coherent phenotypes defined by conserved molecular circuitries (i.e. multiple gene products working together) and since similar cells utilize similar circuits, information about each each expression value or ‘node’ in a multi-cell, multi-gene scRNA-Seq data set is expected to also be predictable from other nodes in the data set. Based on this logic, several approaches have been proposed to impute missing values by extracting information from non-zero measurements in a data set. In this study, we applied non-negative matrix factorization approaches to a selection of published scRNASeq data sets to recommend new values where original measurements are likely to be inaccurate and where ‘zero’ measurements are predicted to be false negatives. The resulting imputed data model predicts novel cell type markers and expression patterns more closely matching gene expression values from orthogonal measurements and/or predicted literature than the values obtained from other previously published imputation approaches.benjamin.spike@hci.utah.eduFIESTA is written in R and is available at https://github.com/elnazmirzaei/FIESTA and https://github.com/TheSpikeLab/FIESTA.	149	0.4079397672826831	3	46	2	0.013422818791946308	3.85

Herein we present Scarf, a modularly designed Python package that seamlessly interoperates with other single-cell toolkits and allows for memory-efficient single-cell analysis of millions of cells on a laptop or low-cost devices like single board computers. We demonstrate Scarf’s memory and compute-time efficiency by applying it to the largest existing single-cell RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq datasets. Scarf wraps memory-efficient implementations of a graph-based t-stochastic neighbour embedding and hierarchical clustering algorithm. Moreover, Scarf performs accurate reference-anchored mapping of datasets while maintaining memory efficiency. By implementing a novel data downsampling algorithm, Scarf additionally can generate representative sampling of cells from a given dataset wherein rare cell populations and lineage differentiation trajectories are conserved. Together, Scarf provides a framework wherein any researcher can perform advanced processing, downsampling, reanalysis, and integration of atlas-scale datasets on standard laptop computers.	146	0.3997262149212868	7	64	0	0	45.55
10.1101/2021.05.03.442435	FALSE	TRUE	scShaper: ensemble method for fast and accurate linear trajectory inference from single-cell RNA-seq data	2021-05-03	Computational models are needed to infer a representation of the cells, i.e. a trajectory, from single-cell RNA-sequencing data that model cell differentiation during a dynamic process. Although many trajectory inference methods exist, their performance varies greatly depending on the dataset and hence there is a need to establish more accurate, better generalizable methods. We introduce scShaper, a new trajectory inference method that enables accurate linear trajectory inference. The ensemble approach of scShaper generates a continuous smooth pseudotime based on a set of discrete pseudotimes. We demonstrate that scShaper is able to infer accurate trajectories for a variety of nonlinear mathematical trajectories, including many for which the commonly used principal curves method fails. A comprehensive benchmarking with state-of-the-art methods revealed that scShaper achieved superior accuracy of the cell ordering and, in particular, the differentially expressed genes. Moreover, scShaper is a fast method with few hyperparameters, making it a promising alternative to the principal curves method for linear pseudotemporal ordering. scShaper is available as an R package at https://github.com/elolab/scshaper.	146	0.3997262149212868	4	15	0	0	11.83

Methods for inferring and reconstructing networks from genomics data have evolved rapidly over the last decade in response to advances in sequencing technology and machine learning. The scale of data collection has increased dramatically; the largest genome-wide gene expression datasets have grown from thousands of measurements to millions of single cells, and new technologies are on the horizon to increase to tens of millions of cells and above.In this work, we present the Inferelator 3.0, which has been significantly updated to integrate data from distinct cell types to learn context-specific regulatory networks and aggregate them into a shared regulatory network, while retaining the functionality of the previous versions. The Inferelator is able to integrate the largest single-cell datasets and learn cell-type specific gene regulatory networks. Compared to other network inference methods, the Inferelator learns new and informative Saccharomyces cerevisiae networks from single-cell gene expression data, measured by recovery of a known gold standard. We demonstrate its scaling capabilities by learning networks for multiple distinct neuronal and glial cell types in the developing Mus musculus brain at E18 from a large (1.3 million) single-cell gene expression dataset with paired single-cell chromatin accessibility data.The inferelator software is available on GitHub (https://github.com/flatironinstitute/inferelator) under the MIT license and has been released as python packages with associated documentation (https://inferelator.readthedocs.io/).	145	0.39698836413415467	15	90	0	0	19.8

Methods that enable integration of these datasets by removing batch effects while preserving biological information are required for unbiased data interpretation. Here we introduce Canek for this purpose. Canek leverages information from mutual nearest neighbor to combine local linear corrections with cell-specific non-linear corrections within a fuzzy logic framework. Using a combination of real and synthetic datasets, we show that Canek corrects batch effects while introducing the least amount of bias compared with competing methods. Canek is computationally efficient and can easily integrate thousands of single-cell transcriptomes from replicated experiments.	143	0.3915126625598905	4	37	0	0	4.85

Using simulated data that closely resembles realistic scRNA-seq, we demonstrate that STARsolo is highly accurate and significantly outperforms pseudoalignment-to-transcriptome tools. STARsolo can replicate the results of, but is considerably faster than CellRanger, currently the most widely used tool for pre-processing scRNA-seq data. In addition to uniquely mapped reads, STARsolo takes account of multi-gene reads, necessary to detect certain classes of biologically important genes. It has a flexible cell barcode processing scheme, compatible with many established scRNA-seq protocols, and extendable to emerging technologies. STARsolo can quantify transcriptomic features beyond gene expression, which we illustrate by analyzing cell-type-specific alternative splicing in the Tabula Muris project.	144	0.3942505133470226	3	53	7	0.04861111111111111	110.8

Single cell assays have recently been integrated with lineage tracing, a set of methods that identify cells of common ancestry to establish bona fide dynamic relationships between cell states. These integrated methods have revealed unappreciated cell dynamics, but their analysis faces recurrent challenges arising from noisy, dispersed lineage data. Here, we develop coherent, sparse optimization (CoSpar) as a robust computational approach to infer cell dynamics from single-cell genomics integrated with lineage tracing. CoSpar is robust to severe down-sampling and dispersion of lineage data, which enables simpler, lower-cost experimental designs and requires less calibration. In datasets representing hematopoiesis, reprogramming, and directed differentiation, CoSpar identifies fate biases not previously detected, predicting transcription factors and receptors implicated in fate choice.

However, the extent to which alternative isoforms establish co-expression networks that may relevant in cellular function has not been explored yet. Here, we present acorde, a pipeline that successfully leverages bulk long reads and single-cell data to confidently detect alternative isoform co-expression relationships. To achieve this, we developed and validated percentile correlations, a novel approach that overcomes data sparsity and yields accurate co-expression estimates from single-cell data. Next, acorde uses correlations to cluster co-expressed isoforms into a network, unraveling cell type-specific alternative isoform usage patterns. By selecting same-gene isoforms between these clusters, we subsequently detect and characterize genes with co-differential isoform usage (coDIU) across neural cell types. Finally, we predict functional elements from long read-defined isoforms and provide insight into biological processes, motifs and domains potentially controlled by the coordination of post-transcriptional regulation.	140	0.38329911019849416	4	96	0	0	23.8
10.1101/2021.05.07.442884	FALSE	TRUE	Chord: Identifying Doublets in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data by an Ensemble Machine Learning Algorithm	2021-05-08	High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a popular method, but it is accompanied by doublet rate problems that disturb the downstream analysis. Several computational approaches have been developed to detect doublets. However, most of these methods have good performance in some datasets but lack stability in others; thus, it is difficult to regard a single method as the gold standard for each scenario, and it is a difficult and time-consuming task for researcher to choose the most appropriate software. To address these issues, we propose Chord which implements a machine learning algorithm that integrates multiple doublet detection methods. Chord had a higher accuracy and stability than the individual approaches on different datasets containing real and synthetic data. Moreover, Chord was designed with a modular architecture port, which has high flexibility and adaptability to the incorporation of any new tools. Chord is a general solution to the doublet detection problem.	141	0.3860369609856263	6	30	0	0	6.1
10.1101/2021.05.10.443350	FALSE	TRUE	Individual Level Differential Expression Analysis for Single Cell RNA-seq data	2021-05-10	Bulk RNA-seq data quantify the expression of a gene in an individual by one number (e.g., fragment count). In contrast, single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data provide much richer information: the distribution of gene expression across many cells. To assess differential expression across individuals using scRNA-seq data, a straightforward solution is to create “pseudo” bulk RNA-seq data by adding up the fragment counts of a gene across cells for each individual, and then apply methods designed for differential expression using bulk RNA-seq data. This pseudo-bulk solution reduces the distribution of gene expression across cells to a single number and thus loses a good amount of information. We propose to assess differential expression using the gene expression distribution measured by cell level data. We find denoising cell level data can substantially improve the power of this approach. We apply our method, named IDEAS (Individual level Differential Expression Analysis for scRNA-seq), to study the gene expression difference between autism subjects and controls. We find neurogranin-expressing neurons harbor a high proportion of differentially expressed genes, and ERBB signals in microglia are associated with autism.	139	0.3805612594113621	6	31	0	0	13.18

Currently, there is no principled way to decide, whether a cluster of cells contains meaningful subpopulations that should be further resolved.

Integrative analysis of large-scale scRNA-seq datasets has the potential of revealing de novo cell types as well as aggregating biological information. However, most existing methods fail to integrate multiple large-scale scRNA-seq datasets in a computational and memory efficient way. We hereby propose OCAT, One Cell At a Time, a graph-based method that sparsely encodes single-cell gene expressions to integrate data from multiple sources without most variable gene selection or explicit batch effect correction. We demonstrate that OCAT efficiently integrates multiple scRNA-seq datasets and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in cell type clustering, especially in challenging scenarios of non-overlapping cell types. In addition, OCAT efficaciously facilitates a variety of downstream analyses, such as differential gene analysis, trajectory inference, pseudotime inference and cell inference. OCAT is a unifying tool to simplify and expedite the analysis of large-scale scRNA-seq data from heterogeneous sources.	136	0.3723477070499658	3	33	0	0	9.8
10.1101/2021.05.12.443928	FALSE	TRUE	Direct Reconstruction of Gene Regulatory Networks underlying Cellular state Transitions without Pseudo-time Inference	2021-05-14	Nowadays the advanced technology for single-cell transcriptional profiling enables people to routinely generate thousands of single-cell expression data, in which data from different cell states or time points are derived from different samples. Without transferring such time-stamped cross-sectional data into pseudo-time series, we propose COSLIR (COvariance restricted Sparse LInear Regression) for directly reconstructing the gene regulatory networks (GRN) that drives the cell-state transition. The differential gene expression between adjacent cell states is modeled as a linear combination of gene expressions in the previous cell state, and the GRN is reconstructed through solving an optimization problem only based on the first and second moments of the sample distributions. We apply the bootstrap strategy as well as the clip threshold method to increase the precision and stability of the estimation. Simulations indicate the perfect accuracy of COSLIR in the oracle case as well as its good performance and stability in the sample case. We apply COSLIR separately to two cell lineages in a published single-cell qPCR dataset during mouse early embryo development. Nearly half of the inferred gene-gene interactions have already been experimentally reported and some of them were even discovered during the past decade after the dataset was published, indicating the power of COSLIR. Furthermore, COSLIR is also evaluated on several single-cell RNA-seq datasets, and the performance is comparable with other methods relying on the pseudo-time reconstruction.	135	0.36960985626283366	9	0	0	0	9.58

We introduce compartmap to reconstruct higher-order chromatin domains in individual cells from transcriptomic (RNAseq) and epigenomic (ATACseq) assays. In cell lines and primary human samples, compartmap infers higher-order chromatin structure comparable to specialized chromatin capture methods, and identifies clinically relevant structural alterations in single cells. This provides a common lens to integrate transcriptional and epigenomic results, linking higher-order chromatin architecture to gene regulation and to clinically relevant phenotypes in individual cells.	131	0.3586584531143053	5	95	0	0	23.15

We develop a novel Dirichlet process mixture model which employs both a mixture at the cell level to model multiple cell types, and a mixture of single cell RNA-seq counts at the transcript level to model the transcript specific zero-inflation of counts. It is shown that this approach outperforms previous approaches that applied multinomial distributions to model single cell RNA-seq counts, and also performs better or comparably to existing top performing methods. By taking a Bayesian approach we are able to build interpretable models of expression within clusters, and to quantify uncertainty in cluster assignments. Applied to a publicly available data set of single cell RNA-seq counts of multiple cell types from the mouse cortex and hippocampus, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to distinguish sub-populations of cells as clusters in the data, and to identify gene sets that are indicative of membership of a sub-population.

To address this problem, we introduce PISCES (Protein-activity Inference for Single Cell Studies), an integrated analytical framework for the protein activity-based analysis of single cell subpopulations. PISCES leverages the assembly of lineage-specific gene regulatory networks, to accurately measure activity of each protein based on the expression its transcriptional targets (regulon), using the ARACNe and metaVIPER algorithms, respectively. It implements novel analytical and visualization functions, including activity-based cluster analysis, identification of cell state repertoires, and elucidation of master regulators of cell state and cell state transitions, with full interoperability with Seurat's single-cell data format. Accuracy and reproducibility assessment, via technical and biological validation assays and by assessing concordance with antibody and CITE-Seq-based measurements, show dramatic improvement in the ability to identify rare subpopulations and to assess activity of key lineage markers, compared to gene expression analysis.	127	0.34770704996577684	7	23	0	0	3.85

However, many of the current state-of-the-art techniques suffer from limitations, such as reliance on a single reference dataset or marker gene set, or excessive run times for large datasets. Acquiring high-quality labeled data to use as a reference can be challenging. With CITE-seq, surface protein expression of cells can be directly measured in addition to the RNA expression, facilitating cell type annotation. Here, we compiled and annotated a collection of 16 publicly available CITE-seq datasets. This data was then used as training data to develop Superscan, a supervised machine learning-based prediction model. Using our 16 reference datasets, we benchmarked Superscan and showed that it performs better in terms of both accuracy and speed when compared to other state-of-the-art cell annotation methods. Superscan is pre-trained on a collection of primarily PBMC immune datasets; however, additional data and cell types can be easily added to the training data for further improvement. Finally, we used Superscan to reanalyze a previously published dataset, demonstrating its applicability even when the dataset includes cell types that are missing from the training set.	127	0.34770704996577684	5	0	0	0	11.78

Many tools have been developed for this purpose. Each of them consists of a resource of intercellular interactions prior knowledge and a method to predict potential cell-cell communication events. Yet the impact of the choice of resource and method on the resulting predictions is largely unknown. To shed light on this, we created a framework, available at https://github.com/saezlab/ligrec_decoupler, to facilitate a comparative assessment of methods for inferring cell-cell communication from single cell transcriptomics data and then compared 15 resources and 6 methods. We found few unique interactions and a varying degree of overlap among the resources, and observed uneven coverage in terms of pathways and biological categories. We analysed a colorectal cancer single cell RNA-Seq dataset using all possible combinations of methods and resources. We found major differences among the highest ranked intercellular interactions inferred by each method even when using the same resources. The varying predictions lead to fundamentally different biological interpretations, highlighting the need to benchmark resources and methods.Built a framework to systematically combine 15 resources and 6 methods to estimate cell-cell communication from single-cell RNA dataCell-cell communication resources are often built from the same original databases and very few interactions are unique to a single resource. Yet overlap varies among resources and certain biological terms are unevenly representedDifferent methods and resources provided notably different resultsThe observed disagreement among the methods could have a considerable impact on the interpretation of results	126	0.34496919917864477	11	67	3	0.023809523809523808	63.45
10.1101/2021.05.21.445165	FALSE	TRUE	Distribution-free complex hypothesis testing for single-cell RNA-seq differential expression analysis	2021-05-23	State-of-the-art methods for single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) Differential Expression Analysis (DEA) often rely on strong distributional assumptions that are difficult to verify in practice. Furthermore, while the increasing complexity of clinical and biological single-cell studies calls for greater tool versatility, the majority of existing methods only tackle the comparison between two conditions. We propose a novel, distribution-free, and flexible approach to DEA for single-cell RNA-seq data. This new method, called ccdf, tests the association of each gene expression with one or many variables of interest (that can be either continuous or discrete), while potentially adjusting for additional covariates. To test such complex hypotheses, ccdf uses a conditional independence test relying on the conditional cumulative distribution function, estimated through multiple regressions. We provide the asymptotic distribution of the ccdf test statistic as well as a permutation test (when the number of observed cells is not sufficiently large). ccdf substantially expands the possibilities for scRNA-seq DEA studies: it obtains good statistical performance in various simulation scenarios considering complex experimental designs i.e. beyond the two condition comparison), while retaining competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods in a two-condition benchmark.	126	0.34496919917864477	4	0	0	0	10.08

Here, we present demuxalot: a method for probabilistic genotype inference from aligned reads, with no assumptions about allele ratios and efficient incorporation of prior genotype information from historical experiments in a multi-batch setting. Our method efficiently incorporates additional information across reads originating from the same transcript, enabling up to 3x more calls per read relative to naive approaches. We also propose a novel and highly performant tradeoff between methods that rely on reference genotypes and methods that learn variants from the data, by selecting a small number of highly informative variants that maximize the marginal information with respect to reference single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Our resulting improved SNV-based demultiplex method is up to 3x faster, 3x more data efficient, and achieves significantly more accurate doublet discrimination than previously published methods. This approach renders scRNAseq feasible for the kind of large multi-batch, multi-donor studies that are required to prosecute diseases with heterogeneous genetic backgrounds.	126	0.34496919917864477	6	18	0	0	14.68
10.1101/2021.05.26.445740	FALSE	TRUE	baredSC: Bayesian Approach to Retrieve Expression Distribution of Single-Cell	2021-05-26	The number of studies using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is constantly growing. This powerful technique provides a sampling of the whole transcriptome of a cell. However, the commonly used droplet-based method often produces very sparse samples. Sparsity can be a major hurdle when studying the distribution of the expression of a specific gene or the correlation between the expressions of two genes. We show that the main technical noise associated with these scRNA-seq experiments is due to the sampling (i.e. Poisson noise). We developed a new tool named baredSC, for Bayesian Approach to Retrieve Expression Distribution of Single-Cell, which infers the intrinsic expression distribution in single-cell data using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). baredSC can be used to obtain the distribution in one dimension for individual genes and in two dimensions for pairs of genes, in particular to estimate the correlation in the two genes’ expressions. We apply baredSC to simulated scRNA-seq data and show that the algorithm is able to uncover the expression distribution used to simulate the data, even in multi-modal cases with very sparse data. We also apply baredSC to two real biological data sets. First, we use it to measure the anti-correlation between Hoxd13 and Hoxa11, two genes with known genetic interaction in embryonic limb. Then, we study the expression of Pitx1 in embryonic hindlimb, for which a trimodal distribution has been identified through flow cytometry. While other methods to analyze scRNA-seq are too sensitive to sampling noise, baredSC reveals this trimodal distribution.	123	0.33675564681724846	2	29	3	0.024390243902439025	11.18
10.1101/2021.05.29.446268	FALSE	TRUE	A Reference-free Approach for Cell Type Classification with scRNA-seq	2021-05-30	The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a revolutionary technology to detect and characterize distinct cell populations under different biological conditions. Unlike bulk RNA-seq, the expression of genes from scRNA-seq is highly sparse due to limited sequencing depth per cell. This is worsened by tossing away a significant portion of reads that cannot be mapped during gene quantification. To overcome data sparsity and fully utilize original sequences, we propose scSimClassify, a reference-free and alignment-free approach to classify cell types with k-mer level features derived from raw reads in a scRNA-seq experiment. The major contribution of scSimClassify is the simhash method compressing k-mers with similar abundance profiles into groups. The compressed k-mer groups (CKGs) serve as the aggregated k-mer level features for cell type classification. We evaluate the performance of CKG features for predicting cell types in four scRNA-seq datasets comparing four state-of-the-art classification methods as well as two scRNA-seq specific algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that the CKG features lend themselves to better performance than traditional gene expression features in scRNA-seq classification accuracy in the majority of cases. Because CKG features can be efficiently derived from raw reads without a resource-intensive alignment process, scSimClassify offers an efficient alternative to help scientists rapidly classify cell types without relying on reference sequences. The current version of scSimClassify is implemented in python and can be found at https://github.com/digi2002/scSimClassify.	119	0.3258042436687201	3	39	0	0	3.1

However, in-depth single-cell transcriptomic characterization of complex tissues often requires profiling tens to hundreds of thousands of cells. Such large numbers of cells represent an important hurdle for downstream analyses, interpretation and visualization. Here we develop a network-based coarse-graining framework where highly similar cells are merged into super-cells. We demonstrate that super-cells not only preserve but often improve the results of downstream analyses including visualization, clustering, differential expression, cell type annotation, gene correlation, imputation, RNA velocity and data integration. By capitalizing on the redundancy inherent to scRNA-seq data, super-cells significantly facilitate and accelerate the construction and interpretation of single-cell atlases, as demonstrated by the integration of 1.46 million cells from COVID-19 patients in less than two hours on a standard desktop.	110	0.30116358658453113	6	63	0	0	25.98

By analyzing scRNA-seq data, one can deconvolve cell states into thousands of gene expression profiles and perform cell clustering. However, conventional gene-based analyses depend on manual literature searches, which are difficult to interpret with clustering results. Here, we present an analysis pipeline named ASURAT, which simultaneously performs unsupervised clustering and biological interpretation in terms of cell type, disease, biological process, and signaling pathway activity. ASURAT uses a correlation graph-based decomposition of functional gene set to define multiple biological terms, which plays a key role in cell state inference. We apply ASURAT to several public scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptome datasets for human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, small cell lung cancer, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Our hybrid approach using the existing methods and ASURAT identifies functional subpopulations, adding another layer of biological interpretability to conventional gene-based analyses.	108	0.29568788501026694	5	70	0	0	10.68

Emerging evidence suggests that the function of trait-associated variants likely acts in a tissue- or cell-type-specific fashion. Yet, it remains challenging to prioritize trait-relevant tissues or cell types to elucidate disease etiology. Here, we present EPIC (cEll tyPe enrIChment), a statistical framework that relates large-scale GWAS summary statistics to cell-type-specific gene expression measurements from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We derive powerful gene-level test statistics for common and rare variants, separately and jointly, and adopt generalized least squares to prioritize trait-relevant cell types while accounting for the correlation structures both within and between genes. Using enrichment of loci associated with four lipid traits in the liver and enrichment of loci associated with three neurological disorders in the brain as ground truths, we show that EPIC outperforms existing methods. We apply our framework to multiple scRNA-seq datasets from different platforms and identify cell types underlying type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia. The enrichment is replicated using independent GWAS and scRNA-seq datasets and further validated using PubMed search and existing bulk case-control testing results.	108	0.29568788501026694	3	70	0	0	9.08
10.1101/2021.06.10.447906	FALSE	TRUE	Discovering single-cell eQTLs from scRNA-seq data only	2021-06-10	eQTL studies are essential for understanding genomic regulation. Effects of genetic variations on gene regulation are cell-type-specific and cellular-context-related, so studying eQTLs at a single-cell level is crucial. The ideal solution is to use both mutation and expression data from the same cells. However, current technology of such paired data in single cells is still immature. We present a new method, eQTLsingle, to discover eQTLs only with single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, without genomic data. It detects mutations from scRNA-seq data and models gene expression of different genotypes with the zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model to find associations between genotypes and phenotypes at single-cell level. On a glioblastoma and gliomasphere scRNA-seq dataset, eQTLsingle discovered hundreds of cell-type-specific tumor-related eQTLs, most of which cannot be found in bulk eQTL studies. Detailed analyses on examples of the discovered eQTLs revealed important underlying regulatory mechanisms. eQTLsingle is a unique powerful tool for utilizing the huge scRNA-seq resources for single-cell eQTL studies, and it is available for free academic use at https://github.com/horsedayday/eQTLsingle.	108	0.29568788501026694	3	67	0	0	10.33

One significant effort in this area is the identification of cell types. With the availability of a huge amount of single cell sequencing data and discovering more and more cell types, classifying cells into known cell types has become a priority nowadays. Several methods have been introduced to classify cells utilizing gene expression data. However, incorporating biological gene interaction networks has been proved valuable in cell classification procedures.In this study, we propose a multimodal end-to-end deep learning model, named sigGCN, for cell classification that combines a graph convolutional network (GCN) and a neural network to exploit gene interaction networks. We used standard classification metrics to evaluate the performance of the proposed method on the within-dataset classification and the cross-dataset classification. We compared the performance of the proposed method with those of the existing cell classification tools and traditional machine learning classification methods.Results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other commonly used methods in terms of classification accuracy and F1 scores. This study shows that the integration of prior knowledge about gene interactions with gene expressions using GCN methodologies can extract effective features improving the performance of cell classification.	104	0.28473648186173856	3	32	1	0.009615384615384616	9.33
10.1101/2021.06.13.448263	FALSE	TRUE	CCPE: Cell Cycle Pseudotime Estimation for Single Cell RNA-seq Data	2021-06-14	The rapid development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies makes it possible to characterize cellular heterogeneity by detecting and quantifying transcriptional changes at the single-cell level. Pseudotime analysis enables to characterize the continuous progression of various biological processes, such as cell cycle. Cell cycle plays an important regulatory role in cell fate decisions and differentiation and is also often regarded as a confounder in scRNA-seq data analysis when analyzing the role of other factors on transcriptional regulation. Therefore, accurate prediction of cell cycle pseudotime and identify cell stages are important steps for characterizing the development-related biological processes, identifying important regulatory molecules and promoting the analysis of transcriptional heterogeneity. Here, we develop CCPE, a novel cell cycle pseudotime estimation method to characterize cell cycle timing and determine cell cycle phases from single-cell RNA-seq data. CCPE uses a discriminative helix to characterize the circular process and estimates pseudotime in the cell cycle. We evaluated the model performance based on a variety of simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets. Our results indicate that CCPE is an effective method for cell cycle estimation and competitive in various downstream analyses compared with other existing methods. CCPE successfully identified cell cycle marker genes and is robust to dropout events in scRNA-seq data. CCPE also has excellent performance on small datasets with fewer genes or cells. Accurate prediction of the cell cycle in CCPE effectively contributes to cell cycle effect removal across cell types or conditions.	104	0.28473648186173856	4	51	0	0	14.63

We developed COSG as a cosine similarity-based method for more accurate and scalable marker gene identification. COSG is applicable to single-cell RNA sequencing data, single-cell ATAC sequencing data and spatially resolved transcriptome data. COSG is fast and scalable for ultra-large datasets of million-scale cells. Application on both simulated and real experimental datasets demonstrates the superior performance of COSG in terms of both accuracy and efficiency as compared with other available methods.

This development has lead to a rush to adapt bulk methods and develop new single-cell-specific methods and tools for computational analysis of these studies. Many single-cell methods have been tested, developed, and benchmarked using simulated data. However, current scRNA-seq simulation frameworks do not allow for the simulation of population-scale scRNA-seq data. Here, we present splatPop, a new Splatter model, for flexible, reproducible, and well documented simulation of population-scale scRNA-seq data with known expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) effects. The splatPop model also allows for the simulation of complex batch effects, cell group effects, and conditional effects between individuals from different cohorts.	101	0.27652292950034224	4	30	2	0.019801980198019802	26.93

Recently, various computational methods have been developed to analyze the scR-NAseq data such as clustering and visualization. However, current visualization methods including t-SNE and UMAP are challenged by the limited accuracy of rendering the geometic relationship of populations with distinct functional states. Most visualization methods are unsupervised, leaving out information from the clustering results or given labels. This leads to the inaccurate depiction of the distances between the bona fide functional states and the variance of clusters. We present supCPM, a robust supervised visualization method, which separates different clusters, preserves global structure, and tracks the cluster variance. Compared with six visualization methods using synthetic and real data sets, supCPM shows improved performance than other methods in preserving the global geometric structure and data variance. Overall, supCPM provides an enhanced visualization pipeline to assist the interpretation of functional transition and accurately depict population segregation.	99	0.27104722792607805	4	25	0	0	4.25

Computational methods are emerging to take advantage of the jointly profiled scRNA-seq and lineage barcode data to better reconstruct the cell division history or to infer the cell state trajectories.Here, we present TedSim (single cell Temporal dynamics Simulator), a simulator that simulates the cell division events from the root cell to present-day cells, simultaneously generating the lineage barcodes and scRNA-seq data. In particular, TedSim generates cells from multiple cell types through cell division events. TedSim can be used to benchmark and investigate computational methods which use either or both of the two types of data, scRNA-seq and lineage barcodes, to study cell lineages, ancestral cells or cell trajectories.

10.1101/2021.06.24.449752	FALSE	TRUE	A Robust and Scalable Graph Neural Network for Accurate Single Cell Classification	2021-06-25	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques provide high-resolution data on cellular heterogeneity in diverse tissues, and a critical step for the data analysis is cell type identification. Traditional methods usually cluster the cells and manually identify cell clusters through marker genes, which is time-consuming and subjective. With the launch of several large-scale single-cell projects, millions of sequenced cells have been annotated and it is promising to transfer labels from the annotated datasets to newly generated datasets. One powerful way for the transferring is to learn cell relations through the graph neural network (GNN), while vanilla GNN is difficult to process millions of cells due to the expensive costs of the message-passing procedure at each training epoch. Here, we have developed a robust and scalable GNN-based method for accurate single cell classification (GraphCS), where the graph is constructed to connect similar cells within and between labelled and unlabelled scRNA-seq datasets for propagation of shared information. To overcome the slow information propagation of GNN at each training epoch, the diffused information is pre-calculated via the approximate Generalized PageRank algorithm, enabling sublinear complexity for a high speed and scalability on millions of cells. Compared with existing methods, GraphCS demonstrates better performance on simulated, cross-platform, and cross-species scRNA-seq datasets. More importantly, our model can achieve superior performance on a large dataset with one million cells within 50 minutes.	93	0.2546201232032854	5	0	0	0	10.43

A common preprocessing step is to adjust the counts for variable sampling efficiency and to transform them so that the variance is similar across the dynamic range. These steps are intended to make subsequent application of generic statistical methods more palatable. Here, we describe three transformations (based on the delta method, model residuals, or inferred latent expression state) and compare their strengths and weaknesses. We find that although the residuals and latent expression state-based models have appealing theoretical properties, in benchmarks using simulated and real-world data the simple shifted logarithm in combination with principal component analysis performs surprisingly well.An R package implementing the delta method and residuals-based variance-stabilizing transformations is available on github.com/const-ae/transformGamPoi.constantin.ahlmann@embl.de	93	0.2546201232032854	2	34	2	0.021505376344086023	68.28

The available technologies continue to evolve and experiments continue to increase in both number and scale. The size, volume, and distinctive characteristics of these data necessitate the development of new software and associated computational methods to accurately and efficiently quantify single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq data into count matrices that constitute the input to downstream analyses.We introduce the alevin-fry framework for quantifying single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq data. Despite being faster and more memory frugal than other accurate and scalable quantification approaches, alevin-fry does not suffer from the false positive expression or memory scalability issues that are exhibited by other lightweight tools. We demonstrate how alevin-fry can be effectively used to quantify single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq data, and also how the spliced and unspliced molecule quantification required as input for RNA velocity analyses can be seamlessly extracted from the same pre-processed data used to generate regular gene expression count matrices.	87	0.23819301848049282	6	37	0	0	40.05

We show that application of Hierarchical Poisson Factorisation (HPF) to scRNA-seq data produces robust factors, and outperforms other popular methods. To account for batch variability in composite data sets, we introduce Integrative Hierarchical Poisson Factorisation (IHPF), an extension of HPF that makes use of a noise ratio hyper-parameter to tune the variability attributed to technical (batches) vs. biological (cell phenotypes) sources. We exemplify the advantageous application of IHPF under data integration scenarios with varying alignments of technical noise and cell diversity, and show that IHPF produces latent factors with a dual block structure in both cell and gene spaces for enhanced biological interpretability.	79	0.216290212183436	2	32	0	0	8.83
10.1101/2021.07.09.450799	FALSE	TRUE	Single-cell transcriptomics for the 99.9% of species without reference genomes	2021-07-10	Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for cell type identification but is not readily applicable to organisms without well-annotated reference genomes. Of the approximately 10 million animal species predicted to exist on Earth, &gt;99.9% do not have any submitted genome assembly. To enable scRNA-seq for the vast majority of animals on the planet, here we introduce the concept of “k-mer homology,” combining biochemical synonyms in degenerate protein alphabets with uniform data subsampling via MinHash into a pipeline called Kmermaid. Implementing this pipeline enables direct detection of similar cell types across species from transcriptomic data without the need for a reference genome. Underpinning Kmermaid is the tool Orpheum, a memory-efficient method for extracting high-confidence protein-coding sequences from RNA-seq data. After validating Kmermaid using datasets from human and mouse lung, we applied Kmermaid to the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus), where we propagated cellular compartment labels at high fidelity. Our pipeline provides a high-throughput tool that enables analyses of transcriptomic data across divergent species’ transcriptomes in a genome- and gene annotation-agnostic manner. Thus, the combination of Kmermaid and Orpheum identifies cell type-specific sequences that may be missing from genome annotations and empowers molecular cellular phenotyping for novel model organisms and species.	78	0.2135523613963039	13	55	0	0	75.75
10.1101/2021.07.10.451910	FALSE	TRUE	A statistical framework for differential pseudotime analysis with multiple single-cell RNA-seq samples	2021-07-12	Pseudotime analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data has been widely used to study dynamic gene regulatory programs along continuous biological processes. While many computational methods have been developed to infer the pseudo-temporal trajectories of cells within a biological sample, methods that compare pseudo-temporal patterns with multiple samples (or replicates) across different experimental conditions are lacking. Lamian is a comprehensive and statistically-rigorous computational framework for differential multi-sample pseudotime analysis. It can be used to identify changes in a biological process associated with sample covariates, such as different biological conditions, and also to detect changes in gene expression, cell density, and topology of a pseudotemporal trajectory. Unlike existing methods that ignore sample variability, Lamian draws statistical inference after accounting for cross-sample variability and hence substantially reduces sample-specific false discoveries that are not generalizable to new samples. Using both simulations and real scRNA-seq data, including an analysis of differential immune response programs between COVID-19 patients with different disease severity levels, we demonstrate the advantages of Lamian in decoding cellular gene expression programs in continuous biological processes.	76	0.2080766598220397	6	41	1	0.013157894736842105	18.2
10.1101/2021.07.14.452387	FALSE	TRUE	Joint Gene Network Construction by Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data	2021-07-14	In contrast to differential gene expression analysis at single gene level, gene regulatory networks (GRN) analysis depicts complex transcriptomic interactions among genes for better understandings of underlying genetic architectures of human diseases and traits. Recently, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data has started to be used for constructing GRNs at a much finer resolution than bulk RNA-seq data and microarray data. However, scRNA-seq data are inherently sparse which hinders direct application of the popular Gaussian graphical models (GGMs). Furthermore, most existing approaches for constructing GRNs with scRNA-seq data only consider gene networks under one condition. To better understand GRNs under different but related conditions with single-cell resolution, we propose to construct Joint Gene Networks with scRNA-seq data (JGNsc) using the GGMs framework. To facilitate the use of GGMs, JGNsc first proposes a hybrid imputation procedure that combines a Bayesian zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model with an iterative low-rank matrix completion step to efficiently impute zero-inflated counts resulted from technical artifacts. JGNsc then transforms the imputed data via a nonparanormal transformation, based on which joint GGMs are constructed. We demonstrate JGNsc and assess its performance using synthetic data. The application of JGNsc on two cancer clinical studies of medulloblastoma and glioblastoma identifies novel findings in addition to confirming well-known biological results.	74	0.2026009582477755	4	83	0	0	1.25
10.1101/2021.07.15.452521	FALSE	TRUE	A completely parameter-free method for graph-based single cell RNA-seq clustering	2021-07-16	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) offers an unprecedented potential for scrutinizing complex biological systems at single cell resolution. One of the most important applications of scRNAseq is to cluster cells into groups of similar expression profiles, which allows unsupervised identification of novel cell subtypes. While many clustering algorithms have been tested towards this goal, graph-based algorithms appear to be the most effective, due to their ability to accommodate the sparsity of the data, as well as the complex topology of the cell population. An integral part of almost all such clustering methods is the construction of a k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) network, and the choice of k, implicitly or explicitly, can have a profound impact on the density distribution of the graph and the structure of the resulting clusters, as well as the resolution of clusters that one can successfully identify from the data. In this work, we propose a fairly simple but robust approach to estimate the best k for constructing the KNN graph while simultaneously identifying the optimal clustering structure from the graph. Our method, named scQcut, employs a topology-based criterion to guide the construction of KNN graph, and then applies an efficient modularity-based community discovery algorithm to predict robust cell clusters. The results obtained from applying scQcut on a large number of real and synthetic datasets demonstrated that scQcut —which does not require any user-tuned parameters—outperformed several popular state-of-the-art clustering methods in terms of clustering accuracy and the ability to correctly identify rare cell types. The promising results indicate that an accurate approximation of the parameter k, which determines the topology of the network, is a crucial element of a successful graph-based clustering method to recover the final community structure of the cell population.ScQcut is written in both Matlab and Python and maybe be accessed through the links below.Matlab version: cs.utsa.edu/ jruan/scQcutPython version: https://github.com/mary77/scQcutJianhua.ruan@utsa.edu	72	0.1971252566735113	2	40	0	0	9.58
10.1101/2021.07.23.453605	FALSE	TRUE	Identifying cell-state associated alternative splicing events and their co-regulation	2021-07-24	Alternative splicing shapes the transcriptome and contributes to each cell’s unique identity, but single-cell RNA sequencing has struggled to capture the impact of alternative splicing. We previously showed that low recovery of mRNAs from single cells led to erroneous conclusions about the cell-to-cell variability of alternative splicing (1). Here, we present a method, Psix, to confidently identify splicing that changes across a landscape of single cells, using a probabilistic model that is robust against the data limitations of scRNA-seq. Its autocorrelation-inspired approach finds patterns of alternative splicing that correspond to patterns of cell identity, such as cell type or developmental stage, without the need for explicit cell clustering, labeling, or trajectory inference. Applying Psix to data that follow the trajectory of mouse brain development, we identify exons whose alternative splicing patterns cluster into modules of co-regulation. We show that the exons in these modules are enriched for binding by distinct neuronal splicing factors, and that their changes in splicing correspond to changes in expression of these splicing factors. Thus, Psix reveals cell-type-dependent splicing patterns and the wiring of the splicing regulatory networks that control them. Our new method will enable scRNA-seq analysis to go beyond transcription to understand the roles of post-transcriptional regulation in determining cell identity.	64	0.17522245037645448	4	56	0	0	23.85
10.1101/2021.07.26.453730	FALSE	TRUE	Self-supervised contrastive learning for integrative single cell RNA-seq data analysis	2021-07-27	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a powerful tool to reveal the complex biological diversity and heterogeneity among cell populations. However, the technical noise and bias of the technology still have negative impacts on the downstream analysis. Here, we present a self-supervised Contrastive LEArning framework for scRNA-seq (CLEAR) profile representation and the downstream analysis. CLEAR overcomes the heterogeneity of the experimental data with a specifically designed representation learning task and thus can handle batch effects and dropout events. In the task, the deep learning model learns to pull together the representations of similar cells while pushing apart distinct cells, without manual labeling. It achieves superior performance on a broad range of fundamental tasks, including clustering, visualization, dropout correction, batch effect removal, and pseudo-time inference. The proposed method successfully identifies and illustrates inflammatory-related mechanisms in a COVID-19 disease study with 43,695 single cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Further experiments to process a million-scale single-cell dataset demonstrate the scalability of CLEAR. This scalable method generates effective scRNA-seq data representation while eliminating technical noise, and it will serve as a general computational framework for single-cell data analysis.	61	0.16700889801505817	10	0	0	0	2.5
10.1101/2021.07.28.454054	FALSE	TRUE	Inferring cell-cell interactions from pseudotime ordering of scRNA-Seq data	2021-07-29	A major advantage of single cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data is the ability to reconstruct continuous ordering and trajectories for cells. To date, such ordering was mainly used to group cells and to infer interactions within cells. Here we present TraSig, a computational method for improving the inference of cell-cell interactions in scRNA-Seq studies. Unlike prior methods that only focus on the average expression levels of genes in clusters or cell types, TraSig fully utilizes the dynamic information to identify significant ligand-receptor pairs with similar trajectories, which in turn are used to score interacting cell clusters. We applied TraSig to several scRNA-Seq datasets. As we show, using the ordering information allows TraSig to obtain unique predictions that improve upon those identified by prior methods. Functional experiments validate the ability of TraSig to identify novel signaling interactions that impact vascular development in liver organoid.	59	0.16153319644079397	6	39	0	0	19.58

However, our understanding of miRNA function at cellular resolution is thwarted by the inability of the standard single cell RNA-seq protocols to capture miRNAs. Here we introduce a machine learning tool -- miRSCAPE -- to infer miRNA expression in a sample from its RNA-seq profile. We establish miRSCAPE’s accuracy separately in 10 tissues comprising ~10,000 tumor and normal bulk samples and demonstrate that miRSCAPE accurately infers cell type-specific miRNA activities (predicted vs observed fold-difference correlation ~ 0.81) in two independent datasets where miRNA profiles of specific cell types are available (HEK-GBM, Kidney-Breast-Skin). When trained on human hematopoietic cancers, miRSCAPE can identify active miRNAs in 8 hematopoietic cell lines in mouse with a reasonable accuracy (auROC = 0.67). Finally, we apply miRSCAPE to infer miRNA activities in scRNA clusters in Pancreatic and Lung cancers, as well as in 56 cell types in the Human Cell Landscape (HCL). Across the board, miRSCAPE recapitulates and provides a refined view of known miRNA biology. miRSCAPE is freely available and promises to substantially expand our understanding of gene regulatory networks at cellular resolution.	58	0.15879534565366188	3	56	0	0	11.2
10.1101/2021.08.01.454654	FALSE	TRUE	Deep Transfer Learning of Drug Responses by Integrating Bulk and Single-cell RNA-seq data	2021-08-02	Massively bulk RNA sequencing databases incorporating drug screening have opened up an avenue to inform the optimal clinical application of cancer drugs. Meanwhile, the growing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data contributes to improving therapeutic effectiveness by studying the heterogeneity of drug responses for cancer cell subpopulations. There is a clear significance in developing computational biology approaches to predict and interpret cancer drug response in single cell data from clinical samples. Here, we introduce scDEAL, a deep transfer learning framework for cancer drug response prediction at single-cell level by integrating large-scale bulk cell line data. The true innovation of scDEAL is to translate cancer cell line drug responses into predicting clinical drug responses via learning relations of gene expressions and drug responses at bulk-level and transfer to predict drug responses in scRNA-seq. Another innovation is the integrated gradient feature interpretation to infer a comprehensive set of signature genes to reveal potential drug resistance mechanisms. We benchmarked scDEAL on six scRNA-seq datasets and indicate its model interpretability through these case studies. We believe that this work may help study cell reprogramming, drug selection, and repurposing for improving therapeutic efficacy.	55	0.15058179329226556	8	51	0	0	3.25

10.1101/2021.08.02.454717	FALSE	TRUE	DropletQC: improved identification of empty droplets and damaged cells in single-cell RNA-seq data	2021-08-02	Advances in droplet-based single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) have dramatically increased throughput, allowing tens of thousands of cells to be routinely sequenced in a single experiment. In addition to cells, droplets capture cell-free 'ambient' RNA predominately caused by lysis of cells during sample preparation. Samples with high ambient RNA concentration can create challenges in accurately distinguishing cell containing droplets and droplets containing ambient RNA. Current methods to separate these groups often retain a significant number of droplets that do not contain cells, so called empty droplets. Additional to the challenge of identifying empty drops, there are currently no methods available to detect droplets containing damaged cells, which comprise of partially lysed cells, the original source of the ambient RNA. Here we describe DropletQC, a new method that is able to detect empty droplets, damaged, and intact cells, and accurately distinguish from one another. This approach is based on a novel quality control metric, the nuclear fraction, which quantifies for each droplet the fraction of RNA originating from unspliced, nuclear pre-mRNA. We demonstrate how DropletQC provides a powerful extension to existing computational methods for identifying empty droplets such as EmptyDrops. We have implemented DropletQC as an R package, which can be easily integrated into existing single cell analysis workflows.	55	0.15058179329226556	2	0	0	0	36.846
10.1101/2021.08.08.453314	FALSE	TRUE	A divide and conquer metacell algorithm for scalable scRNA-seq analysis	2021-08-08	Scaling scRNA-seq to profile millions of cells is increasingly feasible. Such data is crucial for the construction of high-resolution maps of transcriptional manifolds. But current analysis strategies, in particular dimensionality reduction and two-phase clustering, offers only limited scaling and sensitivity to define such manifolds. Here we introduce Metacell-2, a recursive divide and conquer algorithm allowing efficient decomposition of scRNA-seq datasets of any size into small and cohesive groups of cells denoted as metacells. We show the algorithm outperforms current solutions in time, memory and quality. Importantly, Metacell-2 also improves outlier cell detection and rare cell type identification, as we exemplify by analysis of human bone marrow cell atlas and mouse embryonic data. Metacell-2 is implemented over the scanpy framework for easy integration in any analysis pipeline.	49	0.13415468856947296	4	31	0	0	14.25
10.1101/2021.08.10.455720	FALSE	TRUE	geneBasis: an iterative approach for unsupervised selection of targeted gene panels from scRNA-seq.	2021-08-10	The problem of selecting targeted gene panels that capture maximum variability encoded in scRNA-sequencing data has become of great practical importance. scRNA-seq datasets are increasingly being used to identify gene panels that can be probed using alternative molecular technologies, such as spatial transcriptomics. In this context, the number of genes that can be probed is an important limiting factor, so choosing the best subset of genes is vital. Existing methods for this task are limited by either a reliance on pre-existing cell type labels or by difficulties in identifying markers of rare cell types. We resolve this by introducing an iterative approach, geneBasis, for selecting an optimal gene panel, where each newly added gene captures the maximum distance between the true manifold and the manifold constructed using the currently selected gene panel. We demonstrate, using a variety of metrics and diverse datasets, that our approach outperforms existing strategies, and can not only resolve cell types but also more subtle cell state differences. Our approach is available as an open source, easy-to-use, documented R package (https://github.com/MarioniLab/geneBasisR).	47	0.12867898699520877	12	48	0	0	22.65
10.1101/2021.08.12.455997	FALSE	TRUE	Sciviewer enables interactive visual interrogation of single-cell RNA-Seq data from the Python programming environment	2021-08-13	Visualizing two-dimensional (2D) embeddings (e.g. UMAP or tSNE) is a key step in interrogating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data. Subsequently, users typically iterate between programmatic analyses (e.g. clustering and differential expression) and visual exploration (e.g. coloring cells by interesting features) to uncover biological signals in the data. Interactive tools exist to facilitate visual exploration of embeddings such as performing differential expression on user-selected cells. However, the practical utility of these tools is limited because they don’t support rapid movement of data and results to and from the programming environments where the bulk of data analysis takes place, interrupting the iterative process. Here, we present the Single-cell Interactive Viewer (Sciviewer), a tool that overcomes this limitation by allowing interactive visual interrogation of embeddings from within Python. Beyond differential expression analysis of user-selected cells, Sciviewer implements a novel method to identify genes varying locally along any user-specified direction on the embedding. Sciviewer enables rapid and flexible iteration between interactive and programmatic modes of scRNA-Seq exploration, illustrating a useful approach for analyzing high-dimensional data.Code and examples are provided at https://github.com/colabobio/sciviewer	44	0.12046543463381246	2	9	0	0	5

To better understand how this process contributes to the aging phenotype, we built scAgeCom, a comprehensive atlas presenting how cell-type to cell-type interactions vary with age in 23 mouse tissues. We first created an R package, scDiffCom, designed to perform differential intercellular communication analysis between two conditions of interest in any mouse or human single-cell RNA-seq dataset. The package relies on its own list of curated ligand-receptor interactions compiled from seven established studies. We applied this tool to single-cell transcriptomics data from the Tabula Muris Senis consortium and the Calico murine aging cell atlas. All the results can be accessed online, using a user-friendly, interactive web application (https://scagecom.org). The most widespread changes we observed include upregulation of immune system processes, inflammation and lipid metabolism, and downregulation of extracellular matrix organization, growth, development and angiogenesis.

The burgeoning scale of data generation, combined with the proliferation of alternative analysis methods, led us to develop the scFlow toolkit and the nf-core/scflow pipeline for reproducible, efficient, and scalable analyses of single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-sequencing data. The scFlow toolkit provides a higher level of abstraction on top of popular single-cell packages within an R ecosystem, while the nf-core/scflow Nextflow pipeline is built within the nf-core framework to enable compute infrastructure-independent deployment across all institutions and research facilities. Here we present our flexible pipeline, which leverages the advantages of containerization and the potential of Cloud computing for easy orchestration and scaling of the analysis of large case/control datasets by even non-expert users. We demonstrate the functionality of the analysis pipeline from sparse-matrix quality control through to insight discovery with examples of analysis of four recently published public datasets and describe the extensibility of scFlow as a modular, open-source tool for single-cell and single nuclei bioinformatic analyses.	38	0.10403832991101986	6	47	0	0	41.396

Here we acquire single-cell transcriptome and accessible chromatin profiling data over a dense time course covering multiple phases of organoid development including neuroepithelial formation, patterning, brain regionalization, and neurogenesis. We identify temporally dynamic and brain region-specific regulatory regions, and cell interaction analysis reveals emergent patterning centers associated with regionalization. We develop Pando, a flexible linear model-based framework that incorporates multi-omic data and transcription binding site predictions to infer a global GRN describing organoid development. We use pooled genetic perturbation with single-cell transcriptome readout to assess transcription factor requirement for cell fate and state regulation in organoid. We find that certain factors regulate the abundance of cell fates, whereas other factors impact neuronal cell states after differentiation. We show that the zinc finger protein GLI3 is required for cortical fate establishment in humans, recapitulating previous work performed in mammalian model systems. We measure transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in normal or GLI3-perturbed cells and identify a regulome central to the dorsoventral telencephalic fate decision. This regulome suggests that Notch effectors HES4/5 are direct GLI3 targets, which together coordinate cortex and ganglionic eminence diversification. Altogether, we provide a framework for how multi-brain region model systems and single-cell technologies can be leveraged to reconstruct human brain developmental biology.	33	0.09034907597535935	9	64	0	0	54.484
10.1101/2021.08.25.457650	FALSE	TRUE	Identifying Gene-wise Differences in Latent Space Projections Across Cell Types and Species in Single Cell Data using scProject	2021-08-27	Latent space techniques have emerged as powerful tools to identify genes and gene sets responsible for cell-type and species-specific differences in single-cell data. Transfer learning methods can compare learned latent spaces across biological systems. However, the robustness that comes from leveraging information across multiple genes in transfer learning is often attained at the sacrifice of gene-wise precision. Thus, methods are needed to identify genes, defined as important within a particular latent space, that significantly differ between contexts. To address this challenge, we have developed a new framework, scProject, and a new metric, projectionDrivers, to quantitatively examine latent space usage across single-cell experimental systems while concurrently extracting the genes driving the differential usage of the latent space between defined contrasts. Here, we demonstrate the efficacy, utility, and scalability of scProject with projectionDrivers and provide experimental validation for predicted species-specific differences between the developing mouse and human retina.	30	0.08213552361396304	6	54	0	0	4.6

Many single cell methods assume that scRNA-seq data comprises multiple celltypes that are distinct in terms of gene expression, however this is not reflected in current approaches to QC. We show that the current widely-used methods for QC may have a bias towards exclusion of rarer celltypes, especially those whose QC metrics are more extreme, e.g. those with naturally high mitochondrial proportions. We introduce SampleQC, which improves sensitivity and reduces bias relative to current industry standard approaches, via a robust Gaussian mixture model fit across multiple samples simultaneously. We show via simulations that SampleQC is less susceptible than other methods to exclusion of rarer celltypes. We also demonstrate SampleQC on complex real data, comprising up to 867k cells over 172 samples. The framework for SampleQC is general, and has applications as an outlier detection method for data beyond single cell RNA-seq.

The existing algorithms were commonly designed to analyze bulk gene expression data and could not deal with the dropouts and cell heterogeneity in scRNA-seq data. In this paper, we developed dynDeepDRIM that represents gene pair joint expression as images and considers the neighborhood context to eliminate the transitive interactions. dynDeepDRIM integrated the primary image, neighbor images with time-course into a four-dimensional tensor and trained a convolutional neural network to predict the direct regulatory interactions between TFs and genes. We evaluated the performance of dynDeepDRIM on five time-course gene expression datasets. dynDeepDRIM outperformed the state-of-the-art methods for predicting TF-gene direct interactions and gene functions. We also observed gene functions could be better performed if more neighbor images were involved.	27	0.07392197125256673	5	25	0	0	1.25
10.1101/2021.09.01.458524	FALSE	TRUE	CellRegMap: A statistical framework for mapping context-specific regulatory variants using scRNA-seq	2021-09-02	Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables characterizing the cellular heterogeneity in human tissues. Technological advances have enabled the first population-scale scRNA-seq studies in hundreds of individuals, allowing to assay genetic effects with single-cell resolution. However, existing strategies to perform genetic analyses using scRNA-seq remain based on principles established for bulk RNA-seq. In particular, current methods depend on a priori definitions of discrete cell types, and hence cannot assess allelic effects across subtle cell types and cell states. To address this, we propose Cell Regulatory Map (CellRegMap), a statistical framework to test for and quantify genetic effects on gene expression in individual cells. CellRegMap provides a principled approach to identify and characterize heterogeneity in allelic effects across cellular contexts of different granularity, including cell subtypes and continuous cell transitions. We validate CellRegMap using simulated data and apply it to two recent studies of differentiating iPSCs, where we uncover a previously underappreciated heterogeneity of genetic effects across cellular contexts. Finally, we identify fine-grained genetic regulation in neuronal subtypes for eQTL that are colocalized with human disease variants.	24	0.06570841889117043	6	27	0	0	48.6
10.1101/2021.09.01.458620	FALSE	TRUE	Fast and robust non-negative matrix factorization for single-cell experiments	2021-09-01	Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is an intuitively appealing method to extract additive combinations of measurements from noisy or complex data. NMF is applied broadly to text and image processing, time-series analysis, and genomics, where recent technological advances permit sequencing experiments to measure the representation of tens of thousands of features in millions of single cells. In these experiments, a count of zero for a given feature in a given cell may indicate either the absence of that feature or an insufficient read coverage to detect that feature (“dropout”). In contrast to spectral decompositions such as the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the strictly positive imputation of signal by NMF is an ideal fit for single-cell data with ambiguous zeroes. Nevertheless, most single-cell analysis pipelines apply SVD or Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on transformed counts because these implementations are fast while current NMF implementations are slow. To address this need, we present an accessible NMF implementation that is much faster than PCA and rivals the runtimes of state-of-the-art SVD. NMF models learned with our implementation from raw count matrices yield intuitive summaries of complex biological processes, capturing coordinated gene activity and enrichment of sample metadata. Our NMF implementation, available in the RcppML (Rcpp Machine Learning library) R package, improves upon current NMF implementations by introducing a scaling diagonal to enable convex L1 regularization for feature engineering, reproducible factor scalings, and symmetric factorizations. RcppML NMF easily handles sparse datasets with millions of samples, making NMF an attractive replacement for PCA in the analysis of single-cell experiments.	25	0.06844626967830253	3	21	0	0	10.35

Recent breakthroughs generate multiple types of signatures (or multi-omics) from each cell, producing different data ‘omic’ types per single-cell experiment. We introduce MOSCATO, a technique for selecting features across multi-omic single-cell datasets that relate to clinical outcomes. For example, we leverage penalization concepts often used in multi-omic network analytics to accommodate the high-dimensionality where multiple-testing is likely underpowered. We organize the data into multi-dimensional tensors where the dimensions correspond to the different ‘omic’ types. Using the outcome and the single-cell tensors, we perform regularized tensor regression to return a variable set for each ‘omic’ type that forms the clinically-associated network. Robustness is assessed over simulations based on available single-cell simulation methods. Real data comparing healthy subjects versus subjects with leukemia is also considered in order to identify genes associated with the disease. The flexibility of our approach enables future extensions on distributional assumptions and covariate adjustments. This algorithm may identify clinically-relevant genetic patterns on a cellular-level that span multiple layers of sequencing data and ultimately inform highly precise therapeutic targets in complex diseases. Code to perform MOSCATO and replicate the real data application is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/lorinmil/MOSCATO and https://github.com/lorinmil/MOSCATOLeukemiaExample.	22	0.06023271731690623	2	37	0	0	5.2
10.1101/2021.09.03.458844	FALSE	TRUE	Improve consensus partitioning via a hierarchical procedure	2021-09-06	Consensus partitioning is an unsupervised method widely used in high throughput data analysis for revealing subgroups and assigns stability for the classification. However, standard consensus partitioning procedures are weak to identify large numbers of stable subgroups. There are two main issues. 1. Subgroups with small differences are difficult to separate if they are simultaneously detected with subgroups with large differences. And 2. stability of classification generally decreases as the number of subgroups increases. In this work, we proposed a new strategy to solve these two issues by applying consensus partitionings in a hierarchical procedure. We demonstrated hierarchical consensus partitioning can be efficient to reveal more subgroups. We also tested the performance of hierarchical consensus partitioning on revealing a great number of subgroups with a DNA methylation dataset. The hierarchical consensus partitioning is implemented in the R package cola with comprehensive functionality for analysis and visualizations. It can also automate the analysis only with a minimum of two lines of code, which generates a detailed HTML report containing the complete analysis.	20	0.05475701574264202	2	19	0	0	3.35

Important instances include the modeling of microbiome compositions from amplicon sequencing surveys and the analysis of cell type compositions derived from single-cell RNA sequencing. Microbial and cell type abundance data share remarkably similar statistical features, including their inherent compositionality and a natural hierarchical ordering of the individual components from taxonomic or cell lineage tree information, respectively. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian model for tree-aggregated amplicon and single-cell compositional data analysis (tascCODA) that seamlessly integrates hierarchical information and experimental covariate data into the generative modeling of compositional count data. By combining latent parameters based on the tree structure with spike-and-slab Lasso penalization, tascCODA can determine covariate effects across different levels of the population hierarchy in a data-driven parsimonious way. In the context of differential abundance testing, we validate tascCODA’s excellent performance on a comprehensive set of synthetic benchmark scenarios. Our analyses on human single-cell RNA-seq data from ulcerative colitis patients and amplicon data from patients with irritable bowel syndrome, respectively, identified aggregated cell type and taxon compositional changes that were more predictive and parsimonious than those proposed by other schemes. We posit that tascCODA1 constitutes a valuable addition to the growing statistical toolbox for generative modeling and analysis of compositional changes in microbial or cell population data.	20	0.05475701574264202	3	64	0	0	5.8

With advances in sequencing technology thousands to millions of cells can be processed to understand the intricacies of the biological system in question. Annotation through manual curation of markers based on a priori knowledge is cumbersome given this exponential growth. There are currently ~200 computational tools available to help researchers automatically annotate single cells using supervised/unsupervised machine learning, cell type markers, or tissue-based markers from bulk RNA-seq. But with the expansion of publicly available data there is also a need for a tool which can help integrate multiple references into a unified atlas and understand how annotations between datasets compare. Here we present ELeFHAnt: Ensemble learning for harmonization and annotation of single cells. ELeFHAnt is an easy-to-use R package that employs support vector machine and random forest algorithms together to perform three main functions: 1) CelltypeAnnotation 2) LabelHarmonization 3) DeduceRelationship. CelltypeAnnotation is a function to annotate cells in a query Seurat object using a reference Seurat object with annotated cell types.

10.1101/2021.09.08.459475	FALSE	TRUE	Benchmarking of a Bayesian single cell RNAseq differential gene expression test for dose-response study designs	2021-09-10	The application of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) for the evaluation of chemicals, drugs, and food contaminants presents the opportunity to consider cellular heterogeneity in pharmacological and toxicological responses. Current differential gene expression analysis (DGEA) methods focus primarily on two group comparisons, not multi-group dose-response study designs used in safety assessments. To benchmark DGEA methods for dose-response scRNAseq experiments, we proposed a multiplicity corrected Bayesian testing approach and compare it against 8 other methods including two frequentist fit-for-purpose tests using simulated and experimental data. Our Bayesian test method outperformed all other tests for a broad range of accuracy metrics including control of false positive error rates. Most notable, the fit-for-purpose and standard multiple group DGEA methods were superior to the two group scRNAseq methods for dose-response study designs. Collectively, our benchmarking of DGEA methods demonstrates the importance in considering study design when determining the most appropriate test methods.	16	0.04380561259411362	7	48	0	0	2.5

We apply random forest regression to scRNAseq data from mouse brains, which identifies the co-regulation of genes within specific cellular contexts. By analyzing the estimators of the random forest, we identify several novel candidate gene regulatory networks and compare these networks in aged and young mice. We demonstrate that cell populations have cell-type specific phenotypes of aging that are not detected by other methods, including the collapse of differentiating oligodendrocytes but not precursors or mature oligodendrocytes.	12	0.03285420944558522	4	18	0	0	21.58
10.1101/2021.09.17.460824	FALSE	TRUE	Non-linear Archetypal Analysis of Single-cell RNA-seq Data by Deep Autoencoders	2021-09-20	Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have led to successes in discovering novel cell types and understanding cellular heterogeneity among complex cell populations through cluster analysis. However, cluster analysis is not able to reveal continuous spectrum of states and underlying gene expression programs (GEPs) shared across cell types. We introduce scAAnet, an autoencoder for single-cell non-linear archetypal analysis, to identify GEPs and infer the relative activity of each GEP across cells. We use a count distribution-based loss term to account for the sparsity and overdispersion of the raw count data and add an archetypal constraint to the loss function of scAAnet. We first show that scAAnet outperforms existing methods for archetypal analysis across different metrics through simulations. We then demonstrate the ability of scAAnet to extract biologically meaningful GEPs using publicly available scRNA-seq datasets including a pancreatic islet dataset, a lung idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis dataset and a prefrontal cortex dataset.	6	0.01642710472279261	2	56	0	0	7.3
10.1101/2021.09.19.460993	FALSE	TRUE	deCS: A tool for systematic cell type annotations of single-cell RNA sequencing data among human tissues	2021-09-22	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is revolutionizing the study of complex and dynamic cellular mechanisms. However, cell-type annotation remains a main challenge as it largely relies on manual curation, which is cumbersome and less accurate. The increasing number of scRNA-seq data sets, as well as numerous published genetic studies, motivated us to build a comprehensive human cell type reference atlas. Here, we present deCS (decoding Cell type-Specificity), an automatic cell type annotation method based on a comprehensive collection of human cell type expression profiles or a list of marker genes. We applied deCS to single-cell data sets from various tissue types, and systematically evaluated the annotation accuracy under various conditions, including reference panels, sequencing depth and feature selection. Our results demonstrated that expanding the references is critical for improving annotation accuracy. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art annotation tools, deCS significantly reduced computation time while increased accuracy. deCS can be integrated into the standard scRNA-seq analytical pipeline to enhance cell type annotation. Finally, we demonstrated the broad utility of deCS to identify trait-cell type associations in 51 human complex traits, providing deeper insight into the cellular mechanisms of disease pathogenesis.	4	0.010951403148528405	6	74	0	0	2
10.1101/2021.09.20.461129	FALSE	TRUE	Context-aware deconvolution of cell-cell communication with Tensor-cell2cell	2021-09-23	Cell interactions determine phenotypes, and intercellular communication is shaped by cellular contexts such as disease state, organismal life stage, and tissue microenvironment. Single-cell technologies measure the molecules mediating cell-cell communication, and emerging computational tools can exploit these data to decipher intercellular communication. However, current methods either disregard cellular context or rely on simple pairwise comparisons between samples, thus limiting the ability to decipher complex cell-cell communication across multiple time points, levels of disease severity, or spatial contexts. Here we present Tensor-cell2cell, an unsupervised method using tensor decomposition, which is the first strategy to decipher context-driven intercellular communication by simultaneously accounting for multiple stages, states, or locations of the cells. To do so, Tensor-cell2cell uncovers context-driven patterns of communication associated with different phenotypic states and determined by unique combinations of cell types and ligand-receptor pairs. We show Tensor-cell2cell can identify multiple modules associated with distinct communication processes (e.g., participating cell-cell and ligand receptor pairs) linked to COVID-19 severities. Thus, we introduce an effective and easy-to-use strategy for understanding complex communication patterns across diverse conditions.	3	0.008213552361396304	6	72	0	0	17.15
10.1101/205534	FALSE	TRUE	Simultaneous single-cell profiling of lineages and cell types in the vertebrate brain by scGESTALT	2017-10-19	Hundreds of cell types are generated during development, but their lineage relationships are largely elusive. Here we report a technology, scGESTALT, which combines cell type identification by single-cell RNA sequencing with lineage recording by cumulative barcode editing. We sequenced ~60,000 transcriptomes from the juvenile zebrafish brain and identified more than 100 cell types and marker genes. We engineered an inducible system that combines early and late barcode editing and isolated thousands of single-cell transcriptomes and their associated barcodes. The large diversity of edited barcodes and cell types enabled the generation of lineage trees with hundreds of branches. Inspection of lineage trajectories identified restrictions at the level of cell types and brain regions and helped uncover gene expression cascades during differentiation. These results establish scGESTALT as a new and widely applicable tool to simultaneously characterize the molecular identities and lineage histories of thousands of cells during development and disease.	1438	3.9370294318959616	8	57	8	0.005563282336578581	92.334

Here we show that RNA velocity—the time derivative of RNA abundance—can be estimated by distinguishing unspliced and spliced mRNAs in standard single-cell RNA sequencing protocols. We show that RNA velocity is a vector that predicts the future state of individual cells on a timescale of hours. We validate the accuracy of RNA velocity in the neural crest lineage, demonstrate its use on multiple technical platforms, reconstruct the branching lineage tree of the mouse hippocampus, and measure RNA kinetics in human embryonic brain. We expect RNA velocity to greatly aid the analysis of developmental lineages and cellular dynamics, particularly in humans.	1438	3.9370294318959616	17	25	15	0.01043115438108484	118.732

Partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA) provides an interpretable graph-like map of the arising data manifold, based on estimating connectivity of manifold partitions (https://github.com/theislab/paga). PAGA maps provide interpretable discrete and continuous latent coordinates for both disconnected and continuous structure in data, preserve the global topology of data, allow analyzing data at different resolutions and result in much higher computational efficiency of the typical exploratory data analysis workflow — one million cells take on the order of a minute, a speedup of 130 times compared to UMAP. We demonstrate the method by inferring structure-rich cell maps with consistent topology across four hematopoietic datasets, confirm the reconstruction of lineage relations of adult planaria and the zebrafish embryo, benchmark computational performance on a neuronal dataset and detect a biological trajectory in one deep-learning processed image dataset.	1432	3.920602327173169	9	67	24	0.01675977653631285	51.834
10.1101/211417	FALSE	TRUE	GPseudoRank: a permutation sampler for single cell orderings	2017-10-31	A number of pseudotime methods have provided point estimates of the ordering of cells for scRNA-seq data. A still limited number of methods also model the uncertainty of the pseudotime estimate. However, there is still a need for a method to sample from complicated and multi-modal distributions of orders, and to estimate changes in the amount of the uncertainty of the order during the course of a biological development, as this can support the selection of suitable cells for the clustering of genes or for network inference.In an application to a microarray data set our proposed method, GPseudoRank, identifies two modes of the distribution, each of them corresponding to point estimates of orders obtained by a different established method. In an application to scRNA-seq data we demonstrate the potential of GPseudoRank to identify phases of lower and higher pseudotime uncertainty during a biological process. GPseudoRank also correctly identifies cells precocious in their antiviral response.Our method is available on github: https://github.com/magStra/GPseudoRank.magdalena.strauss@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.ukSupplementary materials are available.	1426	3.9041752224503763	3	35	2	0.001402524544179523	7.05
10.1101/211938	FALSE	TRUE	Probabilistic Count Matrix Factorization for Single Cell Expression Data Analysis	2017-10-31	The development of high throughput single-cell sequencing technologies now allows the investigation of the population diversity of cellular transcriptomes. The expression dynamics (gene-to-gene variability) can be quantified more accurately, thanks to the measurement of lowly-expressed genes. In addition, the cell-to-cell variability is high, with a low proportion of cells expressing the same genes at the same time/level. Those emerging patterns appear to be very challenging from the statistical point of view, especially to represent a summarized view of single-cell expression data. PCA is a most powerful tool for high dimensional data representation, by searching for latent directions catching the most variability in the data. Unfortunately, classical PCA is based on Euclidean distance and projections that poorly work in presence of over-dispersed count data with dropout events like single-cell expression data.We propose a probabilistic Count Matrix Factorization (pCMF) approach for single-cell expression data analysis, that relies on a sparse Gamma-Poisson factor model. This hierarchical model is inferred using a variational EM algorithm. It is able to jointly build a low dimensional representation of cells and genes. We show how this probabilistic framework induces a geometry that is suitable for single-cell data visualization, and produces a compression of the data that is very powerful for clustering purposes. Our method is competed against other standard representation methods like t-SNE, and we illustrate its performance for the representation of single-cell expression (scRNA-seq) data.Our work is implemented in the pCMF R-package1.	1426	3.9041752224503763	5	56	4	0.002805049088359046	25.058
10.1101/215723	FALSE	TRUE	SAFE-clustering: Single-cell Aggregated (From Ensemble) Clustering for Single-cell RNA-seq Data	2017-11-07	Accurately clustering cell types from a mass of heterogeneous cells is a crucial first step for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-Seq) data. Although several methods have been recently developed, they utilize different characteristics of data and yield varying results in terms of both the number of clusters and actual cluster assignments.Here, we present SAFE-clustering, Single-cell Aggregated (From Ensemble) clustering, a flexible, accurate and robust method for clustering scRNA-Seq data. SAFE-clustering takes as input, results from multiple clustering methods, to build one consensus solution. SAFE-clustering currently embeds four state-of-the-art methods, SC3, CIDR, Seurat and t-SNE + k-means; and ensembles solutions from these four methods using three hypergraph-based partitioning algorithms. Extensive assessment across 12 datasets with the number of clusters ranging from 3 to 14, and the number of single cells ranging from 49 to 32,695 showcases the advantages of SAFE-clustering in terms of both cluster number (18.9 - 50.0% reduction in absolute deviation to the truth) and cluster assignment (on average 28.9% improvement, and up to 34.5% over the best of the four methods, measured by adjusted rand index). Moreover, SAFE-clustering is computationally efficient to accommodate large datasets, taking &lt;10 minutes to process 28,733 cells.SAFE-clustering, including source codes and tutorial, is free available on the web at http://yunliweb.its.unc.edu/safe/.yunli@med.unc.eduSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	1419	3.885010266940452	6	43	9	0.006342494714587738	9.2
10.1101/217554	FALSE	TRUE	Multi-Omics factor analysis - a framework for unsupervised integration of multi-omic data sets	2017-11-10	Multi-omic studies promise the improved characterization of biological processes across molecular layers. However, methods for the unsupervised integration of the resulting heterogeneous datasets are lacking. We present Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA), a computational method for discovering the principal sources of variation in multi-omic datasets. MOFA infers a set of (hidden) factors that capture biological and technical sources of variability. It disentangles axes of heterogeneity that are shared across multiple modalities and those specific to individual data modalities. The learnt factors enable a variety of downstream analyses, including identification of sample subgroups, data imputation, and the detection of outlier samples. We applied MOFA to a cohort of 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, profiled for somatic mutations, RNA expression, DNA methylation and ex-vivo drug responses. MOFA identified major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and previously underappreciated drivers, such as response to oxidative stress. In a second application, we used MOFA to analyse single-cell multiomics data, identifying coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic changes along cell differentiation.	1416	3.8767967145790556	9	69	7	0.0049435028248587575	102.28
10.1101/217737	FALSE	TRUE	K-nearest neighbor smoothing for high-throughput single-cell RNA-Seq data	2017-11-21	High-throughput single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) is a powerful approach for studying heterogeneous tissues and dynamic cellular processes. However, compared to bulk RNA-Seq, single-cell expression profiles are extremely noisy, as they only capture a fraction of the transcripts present in the cell. Here, we propose the k-nearest neighbor smoothing (kNN-smoothing) algorithm, designed to reduce noise by aggregating information from similar cells (neighbors) in a computationally efficient and statistically tractable manner. The algorithm is based on the observation that across protocols, the technical noise exhibited by UMI-filtered scRNA-Seq data closely follows Poisson statistics. Smoothing is performed by first identifying the nearest neighbors of each cell in a step-wise fashion, based on partially smoothed and variance-stabilized expression profiles, and then aggregating their transcript counts. We show that kNN-smoothing greatly improves the detection of clusters of cells and co-expressed genes, and clearly outperforms other smoothing methods on simulated data. To accurately perform smoothing for datasets containing highly similar cell populations, we propose the kNN-smoothing 2 algorithm, in which neighbors are determined after projecting the partially smoothed data onto the first few principal components. We show that unlike its predecessor, kNN-smoothing 2 can accurately distinguish between cells from different T cell subsets, and enables their identification in peripheral blood using unsupervised methods. Our work facilitates the analysis of scRNA-Seq data across a broad range of applications, including the identification of cell populations in heterogeneous tissues and the characterization of dynamic processes such as cellular differentiation.

Counting unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) instead of reads is still prone to over-estimation due to amplification and sequencing artifacts and under-estimation due to lost molecules. We present an algorithm that corrects for these errors, based on a mechanistic model of the PCR and sequencing process whose parameters have an immediate physical interpretation and are easily estimated. We demonstrate that our algorithm outputs essentially unbiased counts with substantially improved accuracy.	1416	3.8767967145790556	2	13	1	7.062146892655367e-4	2.5
10.1101/218115	FALSE	TRUE	FateID infers cell fate bias in multipotent progenitors from single-cell RNA-seq data	2017-11-11	Differentiation of multipotent cells is a complex process governed by interactions of thousands of genes subject to substantial expression fluctuations. Resolving cell state heterogeneity arising during this process requires quantification of gene expression within individual cells. However, computational methods linking this heterogeneity to biases towards distinct cell fates are not well established. Here, we perform deep single-cell transcriptome sequencing of ~2,000 bone-marrow derived mouse hematopoietic progenitors enriched for lymphoid lineages. To resolve subtle transcriptome priming indicative of distinct lineage biases, we developed FateID, an iterative supervised learning algorithm for the probabilistic quantification of cell fate bias. FateID delineates domains of fate bias within progenitor populations and permits the derivation of high-resolution differentiation trajectories, revealing a common progenitor population of B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which we validated by in vitro differentiation assays. We expect that FateID will enhance our understanding of the process of cell fate choice in complex multi-lineage differentiation systems.	1415	3.8740588637919235	3	51	2	0.0014134275618374558	21.264
10.1101/219188	FALSE	TRUE	Beyond pseudotime: Following T-cell maturation in single-cell RNAseq time series	2017-11-14	Cellular development has traditionally been described as a series of transitions between discrete cell states, such as the sequence of double negative, double positive and single positive stages in T-cell development. Recent advances in single cell transcriptomics suggest an alternative description of development, in which cells follow continuous transcriptomic trajectories. A cell’s state along such a trajectory can be captured with pseudotemporal ordering, which however is not able to predict development of the system in real time. We present pseudodynamics, a mathematical framework that integrates time-series and genetic knock-out information with such transcriptome-based descriptions in order to describe and analyze the real-time evolution of the system. Pseudodynamics models the distribution of a cell population across a continuous cell state coordinate over time based on a stochastic differential equation along developmental trajectories and random switching between trajectories in branching regions. To illustrate feasibility, we use pseudodynamics to estimate cell-state-dependent growth and differentiation of thymic T-cell development. The model approximates a developmental potential function (Waddington’s landscape) and suggests that thymic T-cell development is biphasic and not strictly deterministic before beta-selection. Pseudodynamics generalizes classical discrete population models to continuous states and thus opens possibilities such as probabilistic model selection to single cell genomics.	1412	3.865845311430527	7	27	3	0.002124645892351275	42.58
10.1101/221911	FALSE	TRUE	Wx: a neural network-based feature selection algorithm for next-generation sequencing data	2017-11-18	Next-generation sequencing (NGS), which allows the simultaneous sequencing of billions of DNA fragments simultaneously, has revolutionized how we study genomics and molecular biology by generating genome-wide molecular maps of molecules of interest. For example, an NGS-based transcriptomic assay called RNA-seq can be used to estimate the abundance of approximately 190,000 transcripts together. As the cost of next-generation sequencing sharply declines, researchers in many fields have been conducting research using NGS. The amount of information produced by NGS has made it difficult for researchers to choose the optimal set of target genes (or genomic loci).We have sought to resolve this issue by developing a neural network-based feature (gene) selection algorithm called Wx. The Wx algorithm ranks genes based on the discriminative index (DI) score that represents the classification power for distinguishing given groups. With a gene list ranked by DI score, researchers can institutively select the optimal set of genes from the highest-ranking ones. We applied the Wx algorithm to a TCGA pan-cancer gene-expression cohort to identify an optimal set of gene-expression biomarker (universal gene-expression biomarkers) candidates that can distinguish cancer samples from normal samples for 12 different types of cancer. The 14 gene-expression biomarker candidates identified by Wx were comparable to or outperformed previously reported universal gene expression biomarkers, highlighting the usefulness of the Wx algorithm for next-generation sequencing data. Thus, we anticipate that the Wx algorithm can complement current state-of-the-art analytical applications for the identification of biomarker candidates as an alternative method.https://github.com/deargen/DearWXkangk1204@dankook.ac.krSupplementary data are available at online.	1408	3.8548939082819986	5	18	1	7.102272727272727e-4	15.1

Despite this, few current methods for differential expression (DE) analysis of scRNA-seq data explicitly model the dropout process. We develop DECENT, a DE method for scRNA-seq data that explicitly models the dropout process and performs statistical analyses on the inferred pre-dropout counts. We demonstrate using simulated and real datasets the superior performance of DECENT compared to existing methods. DECENT does not require spike-in data, but spike-ins can be used to improve performance when available.

10.1101/227033	FALSE	TRUE	Gene Expression Distribution Deconvolution in Single Cell RNA Sequencing	2017-11-30	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the quantification of each gene’s expression distribution across cells, thus allowing the assessment of the dispersion, burstiness, and other aspects of its distribution beyond the mean. These statistical characterizations of the gene expression distribution are critical for understanding expression variation and for selecting marker genes for population heterogeneity. However, scRNA-seq data is noisy, with each cell typically sequenced at low coverage, thus making it difficult to infer properties of the gene expression distribution from raw counts. Based on a re-examination of 9 public data sets, we propose a simple technical noise model for scRNA-seq data with Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMI). We develop DESCEND, a method that deconvolves the true cross-cell gene expression distribution from observed scRNA-seq counts, leading to improved estimates of properties of the distribution such as dispersion and burstiness. DESCEND can adjust for cell-level covariates such as cell size, cell cycle and batch effects. DESCEND’s noise model and estimation accuracy are further evaluated through comparisons to RNA FISH data, through data splitting and simulations, and through its effectiveness in removing known batch effects. We demonstrate how DESCEND can clarify and improve downstream analyses such as finding differentially bursty genes, identifying cell types, and selecting differentiation markers.	1396	3.8220396988364134	9	63	6	0.004297994269340974	19.264

However current implementations are computationally intensive and will not scale up to modern droplet-based single-cell datasets which routinely profile many tens of thousands of cells.We provide an efficient implementation which allows scaling up this approach to modern single-cell datasets. We also generalize the application of pseudotime inference to cases where there are other sources of variation, such as branching dynamics. We apply our method on microarray, nCounter, RNA-seq, qPCR and droplet-based datasets from different organisms. The model converges an order of magnitude faster compared to existing methods whilst achieving similar levels of estimation accuracy. Further, we demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by extending the model to higher-dimensional latent spaces that can be used to simultaneously infer pseudotime and other structure such as branching. Thus, the model has the capability of producing meaningful biological insights about cell ordering as well as cell fate regulation.Software available at github.com/ManchesterBioinference/GrandPrix.	1393	3.813826146475017	3	35	5	0.003589375448671931	34.914
10.1101/229815	FALSE	TRUE	Evaluating stably expressed genes in single cells	2017-12-06	Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiling has revealed remarkable variation in transcription, suggesting that expression of many genes at the single-cell level are intrinsically stochastic and noisy. Yet, on cell population level, a subset of genes traditionally referred to as housekeeping genes (HKGs) are found to be stably expressed in different cell and tissue types. It is therefore critical to question whether stably expressed genes (SEGs) can be identified on the single-cell level, and if so, how their expression stability can be assessed? We have developed a computational framework for ranking expression stability of genes in single cells. Here we evaluate the proposed framework and characterize SEGs derived from two scRNA-seq datasets that profile early human and mouse development.Here, we show that gene expression stability indices derived from the early human and mouse development scRNA-seq datasets are highly reproducible and conserved across species. We demonstrate that SEGs identified from single cells based on their stability indices are considerably more stable than HKGs defined previously from cell populations across 10 diverse biological systems. Our analyses indicate that SEGs are inherently more stable at the single-cell level and their characteristics reminiscent of HKGs, suggesting their potential role in sustaining essential functions in individual cells.SEGs identified in this study have immediate utility both for understanding variation/stability of single-cell transcriptomes and for practical applications including scRNA-seq data normalization, the proposed framework can be applied to identify genes with stable expression in other scRNA-seq datasets.	1390	3.805612594113621	9	55	7	0.005035971223021582	19.85

A key computational challenge when processing these data is to distinguish libraries for real cells from empty droplets. Existing methods for cell calling set a minimum threshold on the total unique molecular identifier (UMI) count for each library, which indiscriminately discards cell libraries with low UMI counts. Here, we describe a new statistical method for calling cells from droplet-based data, based on detecting significant deviations from the expression profile of the ambient solution. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our method has greater power than existing approaches for detecting cell libraries with low UMI counts, while controlling the false discovery rate among detected cells. We also apply our method to real data, where we show that the use of our method results in the retention of distinct cell types that would otherwise have been discarded.	1271	3.479808350444901	7	24	10	0.007867820613690008	41.434
10.1101/235382	FALSE	TRUE	Performance Assessment and Selection of Normalization Procedures for Single-Cell RNA-seq	2017-12-16	Systematic measurement biases make data normalization an essential preprocessing step in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. There may be multiple, competing considerations behind the assessment of normalization performance, some of them study-specific. Because normalization can have a large impact on downstream results (e.g., clustering and differential expression), it is critically important that practitioners assess the performance of competing methods.We have developed scone — a flexible framework for assessing normalization performance based on a comprehensive panel of data-driven metrics. Through graphical summaries and quantitative reports, scone summarizes performance trade-offs and ranks large numbers of normalization methods by aggregate panel performance. The method is implemented in the open-source Bioconductor R software package scone. We demonstrate the effectiveness of scone on a collection of scRNA-seq datasets, generated with different protocols, including Fluidigm C1 and 10x platforms. We show that top-performing normalization methods lead to better agreement with independent validation data.	1380	3.7782340862423	8	65	15	0.010869565217391304	53.9
10.1101/237065	FALSE	TRUE	Exploring Single-Cell Data with Deep Multitasking Neural Networks	2017-12-19	Biomedical researchers are generating high-throughput, high-dimensional single-cell data at a staggering rate. As costs of data generation decrease, experimental design is moving towards measurement of many different single-cell samples in the same dataset. These samples can correspond to different patients, conditions, or treatments. While scalability of methods to datasets of these sizes is a challenge on its own, dealing with large-scale experimental design presents a whole new set of problems, including batch effects and sample comparison issues. Currently, there are no computational tools that can both handle large amounts of data in a scalable manner (many cells) and at the same time deal with many samples (many patients or conditions). Moreover, data analysis currently involves the use of different tools that each operate on their own data representation, not guaranteeing a synchronized analysis pipeline. For instance, data visualization methods can be disjoint and mismatched with the clustering method. For this purpose, we present SAUCIE, a deep neural network that leverages the high degree of parallelization and scalability offered by neural networks, as well as the deep representation of data that can be learned by them to perform many single-cell data analysis tasks, all on a unified representation.A well-known limitation of neural networks is their interpretability. Our key contribution here are newly formulated regularizations (penalties) that render features learned in hidden layers of the neural network interpretable. When large multi-patient datasets are fed into SAUCIE, the various hidden layers contain denoised and batch-corrected data, a low dimensional visualization, unsupervised clustering, as well as other information that can be used to explore the data. We show this capability by analyzing a newly generated 180-sample dataset consisting of T cells from dengue patients in India, measured with mass cytometry. We show that SAUCIE, for the first time, can batch correct and process this 11-million cell data to identify cluster-based signatures of acute dengue infection and create a patient manifold, stratifying immune response to dengue on the basis of single-cell measurements.	1377	3.7700205338809036	16	66	9	0.006535947712418301	31.65
10.1101/237214	FALSE	TRUE	Robust expression variability testing reveals heterogeneous T cell responses	2017-12-21	Cell-to-cell transcriptional variability in otherwise homogeneous cell populations plays a crucial role in tissue function and development. Single-cell RNA sequencing can characterise this variability in a transcriptome-wide manner. However, technical variation and the confounding between variability and mean expression estimates hinders meaningful comparison of expression variability between cell populations. To address this problem, we introduce a novel analysis approach that extends the BASiCS statistical framework to derive a residual measure of variability that is not confounded by mean expression. Moreover, we introduce a new and robust procedure for quantifying technical noise in experiments where technical spike-in molecules are not available. We illustrate how our method provides biological insight into the dynamics of cell-to-cell expression variability, highlighting a synchronisation of the translational machinery in immune cells upon activation. Additionally, our approach identifies new patterns of variability across CD4+ T cell differentiation.	1375	3.7645448323066395	5	50	0	0	13.55
10.1101/237420	FALSE	TRUE	A single-cell catalogue of regulatory states in the ageing Drosophila brain	2017-12-21	The diversity of cell types and regulatory states in the brain, and how these change during ageing, remains largely unknown. Here, we present a single-cell transcriptome catalogue of the entire adult Drosophila melanogaster brain sampled across its lifespan. Both neurons and glia age through a process of “regulatory erosion”, characterized by a strong decline of RNA content, and accompanied by increasing transcriptional and chromatin noise. We identify more than 50 cell types by specific transcription factors and their downstream gene regulatory networks. In addition to neurotransmitter types and neuroblast lineages, we find a novel neuronal cell state driven by datilografo and prospero. This state relates to neuronal birth order, the metabolic profile, and the activity of a neuron. Our single-cell brain catalogue reveals extensive regulatory heterogeneity linked to ageing and brain function and will serve as a reference for future studies of genetic variation and disease mutations.	1375	3.7645448323066395	18	59	5	0.0036363636363636364	47.334
10.1101/241646	FALSE	TRUE	DECODE-ing sparsity patterns in single-cell RNA-seq	2018-01-01	An inherent challenge in interpreting single-cell transcriptomic data is the high frequency of zero values. This phenomenon has been attributed to both biological and technical sources, although the extent of the contribution of each remains unclear. Here, we show that the underlying gene presence/absence sparsity patterns are by themselves highly informative. We develop an algorithm, called DECODE, to assess the extent of joint presence/absence of genes across different cells, and to infer a gene dependency network. We show that this network captures biologically-meaningful pathways, cell-type specific modules, and connectivity patterns characteristic of complex networks. We develop a model that uses this network to discriminate biological vs. technical zeros, by exploiting each gene’s local network neighborhood. For inferred non-biological zeros, we build a predictive model that imputes the missing value of each gene based on activity patterns of its most informative neighbors. We show that our framework accurately infers gene-gene functional dependencies, pinpoints technical zeros, and predicts biologically-meaningful missing values in three diverse datasets.	1364	3.7344284736481863	4	23	5	0.0036656891495601175	23.364

However, it remains difficult to detect rare and common cell types at the same time. Here we present a new computational method, called GiniClust2, to overcome this challenge. GiniClust2 combines the strengths of two complementary approaches, using the Gini index and Fano factor, respectively, through a cluster-aware, weighted ensemble clustering technique. GiniClust2 successfully identifies both common and rare cell types in diverse datasets, outperforming existing methods. GiniClust2 is scalable to very large datasets.	1355	3.7097878165639973	2	27	0	0	10.35
10.1101/248633	FALSE	TRUE	Statistical significance of cluster membership for determination of cell identities in single cell genomics	2018-01-16	Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to dissect transcriptional heterogeneity arising from cellular types, spatio-temporal contexts, and environmental stimuli. Cell identities of samples derived from heterogeneous subpopulations are routinely determined by clustering of scRNA-seq data. Computational cell identities are then used in downstream analysis, feature selection, and visualization. However, how can we examine if cell identities are accurately inferred? To this end, we introduce non-parametric methods to evaluate cell identities by testing cluster memberships of single cell samples in an unsupervised manner. We propose posterior inclusion probabilities for cluster memberships to select and visualize samples relevant to subpopulations. Beyond simulation studies, we examined two scRNA-seq data - a mixture of Jurkat and 293T cells and a large family of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We demonstrated probabilistic feature selection and improved t-SNE visualization. By learning uncertainty in clustering, the proposed methods enable rigorous testing of cell identities in scRNA-seq.	1349	3.693360711841205	1	73	0	0	4.5
10.1101/250126	FALSE	TRUE	Observation weights to unlock bulk RNA-seq tools for zero inflation and single-cell applications	2018-01-18	Dropout events in single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) cause many transcripts to go undetected and induce an excess of zero read counts, leading to power issues in differential expression (DE) analysis. This has triggered the development of bespoke scRNA-seq DE methods to cope with zero inflation. Recent evaluations, however, have shown that dedicated scRNA-seq tools provide no advantage compared to traditional bulk RNA-seq tools. We introduce a weighting strategy, based on a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model, that identifies excess zero counts and generates gene and cell-specific weights to unlock bulk RNA-seq DE pipelines for zero-inflated data, boosting performance for scRNA-seq.	1347	3.6878850102669403	9	62	0	0	29.18
10.1101/250704	FALSE	TRUE	Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis of Lineage Diversity and Microenvironment in High-Grade Glioma	2018-01-19	Despite extensive molecular characterization, we lack a comprehensive understanding of lineage identity, differentiation, and proliferation in high-grade gliomas (HGGs). We sampled the cellular milieu of HGGs with massively-parallel single-cell RNA-Seq.While HGG cells can resemble glia or even immature neurons and form branched lineage structures, mesenchymal transformation results in unstructured populations. Glioma cells in a subset of mesenchymal tumors lose their neural lineage identity, express inflammatory genes, and co-exist with marked myeloid infiltration, reminiscent of molecular interactions between glioma and immune cells established in animal models. Additionally, we discovered a tight coupling between lineage resemblance and proliferation among malignantly transformed cells. Glioma cells that resemble oligodendrocyte progenitors, which proliferate in the brain, are often found in the cell cycle. Conversely, glioma cells that resemble astrocytes, neuroblasts, and oligodendrocytes, which are non-proliferative in the brain, are generally non-cycling in tumors.These studies reveal a relationship between cellular identity and proliferation in HGG and distinct population structures that reflects the extent of neural and non-neural lineage resemblance among malignantly transformed cells.	1346	3.685147159479808	14	52	2	0.0014858841010401188	11.9

Here we present Sharq, a versatile preprocessing pipeline designed to work with plate-based 3’-end protocols that include Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs). Sharq performs stringent step-wise trimming of reads, assigns them to features according to a flexible hierarchical model, and uses the barcode and UMI information to avoid amplification biases and produce gene expression tables. Additionally, Sharq provides an extensive plate diagnostics report for quality control and troubleshooting, including that of spatial artefacts. The diagnostics report includes measures of the quality of the individual plate wells as well as a robust assessment which of them contain material from live cells. Collectively, the innovative approaches presented here provide a valuable tool for processing and quality control of single cell RNA-seq data.	1346	3.685147159479808	8	23	6	0.004457652303120356	12.684
10.1101/255711	FALSE	TRUE	ClusterMine: a Knowledge-integrated Clustering Approach based on Expression Profiles of Gene Sets	2018-01-29	Clustering analysis is essential for understanding complex biological data. In widely used methods such as hierarchical clustering (HC) and consensus clustering (CC), expression profiles of all genes are often used to assess similarity between samples for clustering. These methods output sample clusters, but are not able to provide information about which gene sets (functions) contribute most to the clustering. So interpretability of their results is limited. We hypothesized that integrating prior knowledge of annotated biological processes would not only achieve satisfying clustering performance but also, more importantly, enable potential biological interpretation of clusters.Here we report ClusterMine, a novel approach that identifies clusters by assessing functional similarity between samples through integrating known annotated gene sets, e.g., in Gene Ontology. In addition to outputting cluster membership of each sample as conventional approaches do, it outputs gene sets that are most likely to contribute to the clustering, a feature facilitating biological interpretation. Using three cancer datasets, two single cell RNA-sequencing based cell differentiation datasets, one cell cycle dataset and two datasets of cells of different tissue origins, we found that ClusterMine achieved similar or better clustering performance and that top-scored gene sets prioritized by ClusterMine are biologically relevant.ClusterMine is implemented as an R package and is freely available at: www.genemine.org/clustermine.phpjxwang@csu.edu.cnSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	1336	3.6577686516084875	6	38	0	0	5.1
10.1101/256644	FALSE	TRUE	Integration of single-cell RNA-seq data into metabolic models to characterize tumour cell populations	2018-01-30	Metabolic reprogramming is a general feature of cancer cells. Regrettably, the comprehensive quantification of metabolites in biological specimens does not promptly translate into knowledge on the utilization of metabolic pathways. Computational models hold the promise to bridge this gap, by estimating fluxes across metabolic pathways. Yet they currently portray the average behavior of intermixed subpopulations, masking their inherent heterogeneity known to hinder cancer diagnosis and treatment. If complemented with the information on single-cell transcriptome, now enabled by RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), metabolic models of cancer populations are expected to empower the characterization of the mechanisms behind metabolic heterogeneity. To this aim, we propose single-cell Flux Balance Analysis (scFBA) as a computational framework to translate sc-transcriptomes into single-cell fluxomes.We show that the integration of scRNA-seq profiles of cells derived from lung ade-nocarcinoma and breast cancer patients, into a multi-scale stoichiometric model of cancer population: 1) significantly reduces the space of feasible single-cell fluxomes; 2) allows to identify clusters of cells with different growth rates within the population; 3) points out the possible metabolic interactions among cells via exchange of metabolites.The scFBA suite of MATLAB functions is available at https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/scFBA, as well as the case study datasets.chiara.damiani@unimib.it	1335	3.6550308008213555	10	44	1	7.49063670411985e-4	5.5

From snapshots of the transcriptomic profiles of differentiating single cells, the cellular lineage tree that leads from a progenitor population to multiple types of differentiated cells can be derived. The underlying lineage trees of most published datasets are linear or have a single branchpoint, but many studies with more complex lineage trees will soon become available. To test and further develop tools for lineage tree reconstruction, we need test datasets with known trees.PROSSTT can simulate scRNA-seq datasets for differentiation processes with lineage trees of any desired complexity, noise level, noise model, and size. PROSSTT also provides scripts to quantify the quality of predicted lineage trees.https://github.com/soedinglab/prossttsoeding@mpibpc.mpg.de	1334	3.652292950034223	3	10	1	7.496251874062968e-4	11

CALISTA includes four essential single-cell analyses for cell differentiation studies, including single-cell clustering, reconstruction of cell lineage specification, transition gene identification, and pseudotemporal cell ordering. In these analyses, we employ a likelihood-based approach where single-cell mRNA counts are described by a probabilistic distribution function associated with stochastic gene transcriptional bursts and random technical dropout events. We evaluated the performance of CALISTA by analyzing single-cell gene expression datasets from in silico simulations and various single-cell transcriptional profiling technologies, comprising a few hundreds to tens of thousands of cells. A comparison with existing single-cell expression analyses, including MONOCLE 2 and SCANPY, demonstrated the superiority of CALISTA in reconstructing cell lineage progression and ordering cells along cell differentiation paths.

10.1101/258699	FALSE	TRUE	Random forest based similarity learning for single cell RNA sequencing data	2018-02-01	Genome-wide transcriptome sequencing applied to single cells (scRNA-seq) is rapidly becoming an assay of choice across many fields of biological and biomedical research. Scientific objectives often revolve around discovery or characterization of types or sub-types of cells, and therefore obtaining accurate cell–cell similarities from scRNA-seq data is critical step in many studies. While rapid advances are being made in the development of tools for scRNA-seq data analysis, few approaches exist that explicitly address this task. Furthermore, abundance and type of noise present in scRNA-seq datasets suggest that application of generic methods, or of methods developed for bulk RNA-seq data, is likely suboptimal.Here we present RAFSIL, a random forest based approach to learn cell–cell similarities from scRNA-seq data. RAFSIL implements a two-step procedure, where feature construction geared towards scRNA-seq data is followed by similarity learning. It is designed to be adaptable and expandable, and RAFSIL similarities can be used for typical exploratory data analysis tasks like dimension reduction, visualization, and clustering. We show that our approach compares favorably with current methods across a diverse collection of datasets, and that it can be used to detect and highlight unwanted technical variation in scRNA-seq datasets in situations where other methods fail. Overall, RAFSIL implements a flexible approach yielding a useful tool that improves the analysis of scRNA-seq data.The RAFSIL R package is available online at www.kostkalab.net/software.html	1333	3.649555099247091	2	50	1	7.501875468867217e-4	6

Consequently, it becomes possible to track the trajectory of thousands of genes across the cellular lineage trees that represent the temporal emergence of cell types during dynamic processes. However, reconstruction of cellular lineage trees with more than a few cell fates has proved challenging. We present MERLoT (https://github.com/soedinglab/merlot), a flexible and user-friendly tool to reconstruct complex lineage trees from single-cell transcriptomics data and further impute temporal gene expression profiles along the reconstructed tree structures.

10.1101/271163	FALSE	TRUE	Parallelized Inference for Single Cell Transcriptomic Clustering with Split Merge Sampling on DPMM Model	2018-02-25	Motivation: With the development of droplet based systems, massive single cell transcriptome data has become available, which enables analysis of cellular and molecular processes at single cell resolution and is instrumental to understanding many biological processes. While state-of-the-art clustering methods have been applied to the data, they face challenges in the following aspects: (1) the clustering quality still needs to be improved; (2) most models need prior knowledge on number of clusters, which is not always available; (3) there is a demand for faster computational speed.Results: We propose to tackle these challenges with Parallelized Split Merge Sampling on Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (the Para-DPMM model). Unlike classic DPMM methods that perform sampling on each single data point, the split merge mechanism samples on the cluster level, which significantly improves convergence and optimality of the result. The model is highly parallelized and can utilize the computing power of high performance computing (HPC) clusters, enabling massive inference on huge datasets. Experiment results show the model achieves about 7% improvement in clustering accuracy for small datasets and more than 20% improvement for large challenging datasets compared with current widely used models. In the mean time, the model’s computing speed is significantly faster.Availability: Source code is publicly available on https://github.com/tiehangd/Para_DPMM/tree/master/Para_DPMM_package	1309	3.583846680355921	3	34	1	7.639419404125286e-4	1.75
10.1101/272443	FALSE	TRUE	Learning common and specific patterns from data of multiple interrelated biological scenarios with matrix factorization	2018-02-27	High-throughput biological technologies (e.g., ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq) rapidly accelerate the accumulation of genome-wide omics data in diverse interrelated biological scenarios (e.g., cells, tissues and conditions). Data dimension reduction and differential analysis are two common paradigms for exploring and analyzing such data. However, they are typically used in a separate or/and sequential manner. In this study, we propose a flexible non-negative matrix factorization framework CSMF to combine them into one paradigm to simultaneously reveal common and specific patterns from data generated under interrelated biological scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CSMF with four applications including pairwise ChIP-seq data describing the chromatin modification map on protein-DNA interactions between K562 and Huvec cell lines; pairwise RNA-seq data representing the expression profiles of two cancers (breast invasive carcinoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma); RNA-seq data of three breast cancer subtypes; and single-cell sequencing data of human embryonic stem cells and differentiated cells at six time points. Extensive analysis yields novel insights into hidden combinatorial patterns embedded in these interrelated multi-modal data. Results demonstrate that CSMF is a powerful tool to uncover common and specific patterns with significant biological implications from data of interrelated biological scenarios.	1307	3.578370978781656	2	39	1	7.651109410864575e-4	4.35
10.1101/276261	FALSE	TRUE	Visualizing and interpreting single-cell gene expression datasets with Similarity Weighted Nonnegative Embedding	2018-03-05	High throughput single-cell gene expression profiling has enabled the characterization of novel cell types and developmental trajectories. Visualizing these datasets is crucial to biological interpretation, and the most popular method is t-Stochastic Neighbor embedding (t-SNE), which visualizes local patterns better than other methods, but often distorts global structure, such as distances between clusters. We developed Similarity Weighted Nonnegative Embedding (SWNE), which enhances interpretation of datasets by embedding the genes and factors that separate cell states alongside the cells on the visualization, captures local structure better than t-SNE and existing methods, and maintains fidelity when visualizing global structure. SWNE uses nonnegative matrix factorization to decompose the gene expression matrix into biologically relevant factors, embeds the cells, genes and factors in a 2D visualization, and uses a similarity matrix to smooth the embeddings. We demonstrate SWNE on single cell RNA-seq data from hematopoietic progenitors and human brain cells.	1301	3.561943874058864	3	43	3	0.0023059185242121443	13.95

The advance in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) provides the snapshots of single cell transcriptomes, thus offering an essential opportunity to study such complex biological processes. Here, we introduce a novel algorithm, DensityPath, which visualizes and reconstructs the underlying cell developmental trajectories for large-scale scRNAseq data. DensityPath has three merits. Firstly, by adopting the nonlinear dimension reduction algorithm elastic embedding, DensityPath reveals the intrinsic structures of the data. Secondly, by applying the powerful level set clustering method, DensityPath extracts the separate high density clusters of representative cell states (RCSs) from the single cell multimodal density landscape of gene expression space, enabling it to handle the heterogeneous scRNAseq data elegantly and accurately. Thirdly, DensityPath constructs cell state-transition path by finding the geodesic minimum spanning tree of the RCSs on the surface of the density landscape, making it more computationally efficient and accurate for large-scale dataset. The cell state-transition path constructed by DensityPath has the physical interpretation as the minimum-transition-energy (least-cost) path. We demonstrate that DensityPath is capable of identifying complex cell development trajectories with bifurcating and trifurcating branches on the human preimplantation embryos. We demonstrate that DensityPath is robust and has high accuracy of pseudotime calculation and branch assignment on the real scRNAseq as well as simulated datasets.	1301	3.561943874058864	6	41	1	7.686395080707148e-4	11.33
10.1101/276907	FALSE	TRUE	A comparison of single-cell trajectory inference methods: towards more accurate and robust tools	2018-03-05	Using single-cell-omics data, it is now possible to computationally order cells along trajectories, allowing the unbiased study of cellular dynamic processes. Since 2014, more than 50 trajectory inference methods have been developed, each with its own set of methodological characteristics. As a result, choosing a method to infer trajectories is often challenging, since a comprehensive assessment of the performance and robustness of each method is still lacking. In order to facilitate the comparison of the results of these methods to each other and to a gold standard, we developed a global framework to benchmark trajectory inference tools. Using this framework, we compared the trajectories from a total of 29 trajectory inference methods, on a large collection of real and synthetic datasets. We evaluate methods using several metrics, including accuracy of the inferred ordering, correctness of the network topology, code quality and user friendliness. We found that some methods, including Slingshot, TSCAN and Monocle DDRTree, clearly outperform other methods, although their performance depended on the type of trajectory present in the data. Based on our benchmarking results, we therefore developed a set of guidelines for method users. However, our analysis also indicated that there is still a lot of room for improvement, especially for methods detecting complex trajectory topologies. Our evaluation pipeline can therefore be used to spearhead the development of new scalable and more accurate methods, and is available at github.com/dynverse/dynverse.To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive assessment of trajectory inference methods. For now, we exclusively evaluated the methods on their default parameters, but plan to add a detailed parameter tuning procedure in the future. We gladly welcome any discussion and feedback on key decisions made as part of this study, including the metrics used in the benchmark, the quality control checklist, and the implementation of the method wrappers. These discussions can be held at github.com/dynverse/dynverse/issues.	1301	3.561943874058864	4	105	49	0.03766333589546503	109.458
10.1101/280545	FALSE	TRUE	clusterExperiment and RSEC: A Bioconductor package and framework for clustering of single-cell and other large gene expression datasets	2018-03-12	Clustering of genes and/or samples is a common task in gene expression analysis. The goals in clustering can vary, but an important scenario is that of finding biologically meaningful subtypes within the samples. This is an application that is particularly appropriate when there are large numbers of samples, as in many human disease studies. With the increasing popularity of single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), many more controlled experiments on model organisms are similarly creating large gene expression datasets with the goal of detecting previously unknown heterogeneity within cells.It is common in the detection of novel subtypes to run many clustering algorithms, as well as rely on subsampling and ensemble methods to improve robustness. We introduce a Bioconductor R package, clusterExperiment, that implements a general and flexible strategy we entitle Resampling-based Sequential Ensemble Clustering (RSEC). RSEC enables the user to easily create multiple, competing clusterings of the data based on different techniques and associated tuning parameters, including easy integration of resampling and sequential clustering, and then provides methods for consolidating the multiple clusterings into a final consensus clustering. The package is modular and allows the user to separately apply the individual components of the RSEC procedure, i.e., apply multiple clustering algorithms, create a consensus clustering or choose tuning parameters, and merge clusters. Additionally, clusterExperimentprovides a variety of visualization tools for the clustering process, as well as methods for the identification of possible cluster signatures or biomarkers.The package clusterExperimentis publicly available through the Bioconductor Project, with a detailed manual (vignette) as well as well documented help pages for each function.	1294	3.542778918548939	7	23	1	7.727975270479134e-4	40.25

We first developed a computational framework that enables unbiased, granular cell-type annotation of scRNA-seq. This approach identified a macrophage subpopulation that was specific to injured lung and notable for high expression of Cx3cr1+ and MHCII genes. We found that these macrophages, which bear a gene expression profile consistent with monocytic origin, progressively acquire alveolar macrophage identity and localize to sites of fibroblast accumulation. Probing their functional role, in vitro studies showed a trophic effect of these cells on fibroblast activation, and ablation of Cx3cr1-expressing cells suppressed fibrosis in vivo. We also found by gene set analysis and immunofluorescence that markers of these macrophages were upregulated in samples from patients with lung fibrosis compared with healthy controls. Taken together, our results uncover a specific pathologic subgroup of macrophages with markers that could enable their therapeutic targeting for fibrosis.	1287	3.5236139630390144	9	37	4	0.003108003108003108	7.85
10.1101/285056	FALSE	TRUE	Semi-soft Clustering of Single Cell Data	2018-03-19	Motivated by the dynamics of development, in which cells of recognizable types, or pure cell types, transition into other types over time, we propose a method of semi-soft clustering that can classify both pure and intermediate cell types from data on gene expression or protein abundance from individual cells. Called SOUP, for Semi-sOft clUstering with Pure cells, this novel algorithm reveals the clustering structure for both pure cells, which belong to one single cluster, as well as transitional cells with soft memberships. SOUP involves a two-step process: identify the set of pure cells and then estimate a membership matrix. To find pure cells, SOUP uses the special block structure the K cell types form in a similarity matrix, devised by pairwise comparison of the gene expression profiles of individual cells. Once pure cells are identified, they provide the key information from which the membership matrix can be computed. SOUP is applicable to general clustering problems as well, as long as the unrestrictive modeling assumptions hold. The performance of SOUP is documented via extensive simulation studies. Using SOUP to analyze two single cell data sets from brain shows it produce sensible and interpretable results.	1287	3.5236139630390144	4	30	0	0	4.1
10.1101/289223	FALSE	TRUE	Neural Data Visualization for Scalable and Generalizable Single Cell Analysis	2018-03-27	Single-cell RNA sequencing is becoming effective and accessible as emerging technologies push its scale to millions of cells and beyond. Visualizing the landscape of single cell expression has been a fundamental tool in single cell analysis. However, standard methods for visualization, such as t-stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), not only lack scalability to data sets with millions of cells, but also are unable to generalize to new cells, an important ability for transferring knowledge across fast-accumulating data sets. We introduce net-SNE, which trains a neural network to learn a high quality visualization of single cells that newly generalizes to unseen data. While matching the visualization quality of t-SNE on 14 benchmark data sets of varying sizes, from hundreds to 1.3 million cells, net-SNE also effectively positions previously unseen cells, even when an entire subtype is missing from the initial data set or when the new cells are from a different sequencing experiment. Furthermore, given a “reference” visualization, net-SNE can vastly reduce the computational burden of visualizing millions of single cells from multiple days to just a few minutes of runtime. Our work provides a general framework for newly bootstrapping single cell analysis from existing data sets.	1279	3.5017111567419574	3	47	2	0.001563721657544957	3.75
10.1101/292037	FALSE	TRUE	Bayesian Inference for a Generative Model of Transcriptome Profiles from Single-cell RNA Sequencing	2018-03-30	Transcriptome profiles of individual cells reflect true and often unexplored biological diversity, but are also affected by noise of biological and technical nature. This raises the need to explicitly model the resulting uncertainty and take it into account in any downstream analysis, such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, and differential expression. Here, we introduce Single-cell Variational Inference (scVI), a scalable framework for probabilistic representation and analysis of gene expression in single cells. Our model uses variational inference and stochastic optimization of deep neural networks to approximate the parameters that govern the distribution of expression values of each gene in every cell, using a non-linear mapping between the observations and a low-dimensional latent space.By doing so, scVI pools information between similar cells or genes while taking nuisance factors of variation such as batch effects and limited sensitivity into account. To evaluate scVI, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis to existing methods for distributional modeling and dimensionality reduction, all of which rely on generalized linear models. We first show that scVI scales to over one million cells, whereas competing algorithms can process at most tens of thousands of cells. Next, we show that scVI fits unseen data more closely and can impute missing data more accurately, both indicative of a better generalization capacity. We then utilize scVI to conduct a set of fundamental analysis tasks – including batch correction, visualization, clustering and differential expression – and demonstrate its accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art tools in each task. scVI is publicly available, and can be readily used as a principled and inclusive solution for multiple tasks of single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis.	1276	3.4934976043805612	5	48	18	0.014106583072100314	49.76

However, noise due to amplification and dropout may obstruct analyses, so scalable denoising methods for increasingly large but sparse scRNAseq data are needed. We propose a deep count autoencoder network (DCA) to denoise scRNA-seq datasets. DCA takes the count distribution, overdispersion and sparsity of the data into account using a zero-inflated negative binomial noise model, and nonlinear gene-gene or gene-dispersion interactions are captured. Our method scales linearly with the number of cells and can therefore be applied to datasets of millions of cells. We demonstrate that DCA denoising improves a diverse set of typical scRNA-seq data analyses using simulated and real datasets. DCA outperforms existing methods for data imputation in quality and speed, enhancing biological discovery.	1262	3.455167693360712	5	46	16	0.012678288431061807	135.856

However, any cell free RNAs contained within the input solution are also captured by these assays. This sequencing of cell free RNA constitutes a background contamination that confounds the biological interpretation of single-cell transcriptomic data.We demonstrate that contamination from this ‘soup’ of cell free RNAs is ubiquitous, with experiment-specific variations in composition and magnitude. We present a method, SoupX, for quantifying the extent of the contamination and estimating ‘background corrected’ cell expression profiles that seamlessly integrate with existing downstream analysis tools. Applying this method to several datasets using multiple droplet sequencing technologies, we demonstrate that its application improves biological interpretation of otherwise misleading data, as well as improving quality control metrics.We present ‘SoupX’, a tool for removing ambient RNA contamination from droplet based single cell RNA sequencing experiments. This tool has broad applicability and its application can improve the biological utility of existing and future data sets.The signal from droplet based single cell RNA sequencing is ubiquitously contaminated by capture of ambient mRNA.SoupX is a method to quantify the abundance of these ambient mRNAs and remove them.Correcting for ambient mRNA contamination improves biological interpretation.	1255	3.436002737850787	2	24	72	0.05737051792828685	69.564

10.1101/310599	FALSE	TRUE	Identifying Gene Expression Programs of Cell-type Identity and Cellular Activity with Single-Cell RNA-Seq	2018-04-30	Identifying gene expression programs underlying both cell-type identity and cellular activities (e.g. life-cycle processes, responses to environmental cues) is crucial for understanding the organization of cells and tissues. Although single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) can quantify transcripts in individual cells, each cell’s expression profile may be a mixture of both types of programs, making them difficult to disentangle. Here we illustrate and enhance the use of matrix factorization as a solution to this problem. We show with simulations that a method that we call consensus non-negative matrix factorization (cNMF) accurately infers identity and activity programs, including the relative contribution of programs in each cell. Applied to published brain organoid and visual cortex scRNA-Seq datasets, cNMF refines the hierarchy of cell types and identifies both expected (e.g. cell cycle and hypoxia) and intriguing novel activity programs. We propose that one of the novel programs may reflect a neurosecretory phenotype and a second may underlie the formation of neuronal synapses. We make cNMF available to the community and illustrate how this approach can provide key insights into gene expression variation within and between cell types.	1245	3.4086242299794662	7	53	7	0.005622489959839358	15.534

In this process, similar cells are grouped before determining co-expressed marker genes for phenotype inference. The performance of computational tools is directly associated to their marker identification accuracy, but the lack of an optimal solution challenges a systematic method comparison. Moreover, phenotypes from different studies are challenging to integrate, due to varying resolution, methodology and experimental design. In this work we introduce matchSCore (https://github.com/elimereu/matchSCore), an approach to match cell populations fast across tools, experiments and technologies. We compared 14 computational methods and evaluated their accuracy in clustering and gene marker identification in simulated data sets. We further used matchSCore to project cell type identities across mouse and human cell atlas projects. Despite originating from different technologies, cell populations could be matched across data sets, allowing the assignment of clusters to reference maps and their annotation.	1238	3.3894592744695413	11	39	9	0.007269789983844911	25.25

With deep generative models one can work directly with count data, make likelihood-based model comparison, learn a latent representation of the cells and capture more of the variability in different cell populations.We propose a novel method based on variational auto-encoders (VAEs) for analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. It avoids data preprocessing by using raw count data as input and can robustly estimate the expected gene expression levels and a latent representation for each cell. We tested several count likelihood functions and a variant of the VAE that has a priori clustering in the latent space. We show for several scRNA-seq data sets that our method outperforms recently proposed scRNA-seq methods in clustering cells and that the resulting clusters reflect cell types.Our method, called scVAE, is implemented in Python using the TensorFlow machine-learning library, and it is freely available at https://github.com/scvae/scvae.	1229	3.3648186173853527	6	50	30	0.024410089503661515	23.28

Further study of single cell profiles across different conditions enables the understanding of biological processes and underlying mechanisms at the sub-population level. However, developing proper methodology to compare multiple scRNA-Seq datasets remains challenging. We have developed ClusterMap, a systematic method and workflow to facilitate the comparison of scRNA profiles across distinct biological contexts. Using hierarchical clustering of the marker genes of each sub-group, ClusterMap matches the sub-types of cells across different samples and provides “similarity” as a metric to quantify the quality of the match. We introduce a purity tree cut method designed specifically for this matching problem. We use Circos plot and regrouping method to visualize the results concisely. Furthermore, we propose a new metric “separability” to summarize sub-population changes among all sample pairs. In three case studies, we demonstrate that ClusterMap has the ability to offer us further insight into the different molecular mechanisms of cellular sub-populations across different conditions.

As a number of computational tools have been developed to identify and visualize cell populations within a single scRNA-seq dataset, there is a need for methods to quantitatively and statistically define proportional shifts in cell population structures across datasets, such expansion or shrinkage, or emergence or disappearance of cell populations. Here we present sc-UniFrac, a framework to statistically quantify compositional diversity in cell populations between single-cell transcriptome landscapes. sc-UniFrac enables sensitive and robust quantification in simulated and experimental datasets in terms of both population identity and quantity. We have demonstrated the utility of sc-UniFrac in multiple applications, including assessment of biological and technical replicates, classification of tissue phenotypes, identification and definition of altered cell populations, and benchmarking batch correction tools. sc-UniFrac provides a framework for quantifying diversity or alterations in cell populations across conditions, and has broad utility for gaining insight on how cell populations respond to perturbations.	1215	3.326488706365503	11	51	1	8.230452674897119e-4	14.35

These high-throughput assays increasingly require special consideration in experimental design, sample multiplexing, batch effect removal, and data interpretation. Here, we describe a lentiviral barcode-based multiplexing approach, ‘CellTag Indexing’, where we transduce and label samples that can then be pooled together for downstream experimentation and analysis. By introducing predefined genetic barcodes that are transcribed and readily detected, we can reliably read out sample identity and transcriptional state via single-cell profiling. We validate and demonstrate the utility of CellTag Indexing by sequencing transcriptomes at single-cell resolution using a variety of cell types including mouse pre-B cells, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and human HEK293T cells. A unique feature of CellTag Indexing is that the barcodes are heritable. This enables cell populations to be tagged, pooled and tracked over time within the same experimental replicate, then processed together to minimize unwanted biological and technical variation. We demonstrate this feature of CellTagging in long-term tracking of cell engraftment and differentiation, in vivo, in a mouse model of competitive transplant into the large intestine. Together, this presents CellTag Indexing as a broadly applicable genetic multiplexing tool that is complementary with existing single-cell technologies.	1214	3.323750855578371	7	55	4	0.0032948929159802307	102.384

The scRNA-seq data provide us with detailed information about the cellular states but, despite several pioneering efforts, it remains an open research question how regulatory networks could be inferred from these noisy discrete read count data.Here, we introduce a hierarchical regression model which is designed for detecting dependencies in scRNA-seq and other count data. We model count data using the Poisson-log normal distribution and, by means of our hierarchical formulation, detect the dependencies between genes using linear regression model for the latent, cell-specific gene expression rate parameters. The hierarchical formulation allows us to model count data without artificial data transformations and makes it possible to incorporate normalization information directly into the latent layer of the model. We test the proposed approach using both simulated and experimental data. Our results show that the proposed approach performs better than standard regression techniques in parameter inference task as well as in variable selection task.An implementation of the method is available athttps://github.com/jeintos/SCHiRM.jukka.intosalmi@aalto.fi,harri.lahdesmaki@aalto.fi	1214	3.323750855578371	4	28	5	0.004118616144975288	12.83

These technical artifacts are caused by cell doublets formed during cell capture and occur at a frequency proportional to the total number of sequenced cells. The presence of doublets can lead to spurious biological conclusions, which justifies the practice of sequencing fewer cells to limit doublet formation rates. Here, we present a computational doublet detection tool – DoubletFinder – that identifies doublets based solely on gene expression features. DoubletFinder infers the putative gene expression profile of real doublets by generating artificial doublets from existing scRNA-seq data. Neighborhood detection in gene expression space then identifies sequenced cells with increased probability of being doublets based on their proximity to artificial doublets. DoubletFinder robustly identifies doublets across scRNA-seq datasets with variable numbers of cells and sequencing depth, and predicts false-negative and false-positive doublets defined using conventional barcoding approaches. We anticipate that DoubletFinder will aid in scRNA-seq data analysis and will increase the throughput and accuracy of scRNA-seq experiments.	1194	3.268993839835729	3	20	17	0.01423785594639866	97.514

However, a significant problem of current scRNA-seq data is the large fractions of missing values or “dropouts” in gene counts. Incorrect handling of dropouts may affect downstream bioinformatics analysis. As the number of scRNA-seq datasets grows drastically, it is crucial to have accurate and efficient imputation methods to handle these dropouts.We present DeepImpute, a deep neural network based imputation algorithm. The architecture of DeepImpute efficiently uses dropout layers and loss functions to learn patterns in the data, allowing for accurate imputation.Overall DeepImpute yields better accuracy than other publicly available scRNA-Seq imputation methods on experimental data, as measured by mean squared error or Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Moreover, its efficient implementation provides significantly higher performance over the other methods as dataset size increases. Additionally, as a machine learning method, DeepImpute allows to use a subset of data to train the model and save even more computing time, without much sacrifice on the prediction accuracy.DeepImpute is an accurate, fast and scalable imputation tool that is suited to handle the ever increasing volume of scRNA-seq data.

It is often important to identify informative genes or cell-type-discriminative markers to reduce dimensionality and achieve informative cell typing results. We present an ab initio method that performs unsupervised marker selection by identifying genes that have subpopulation-discriminative expression levels and are co- or mutually-exclusively expressed with other genes. Consistent improvements in cell-type classification and biologically meaningful marker selection are achieved by applying SCMarker on various datasets in multiple tissue types, followed by a variety of clustering algorithms. The source code of SCMarker is publicly available at https://github.com/KChen-lab/SCMarker.Single cell RNA-sequencing technology simultaneously provides the mRNA transcript levels of thousands of genes in thousands of cells. A frequent requirement of single cell expression analysis is the identification of markers which may explain complex cellular states or tissue composition. We propose a new marker selection strategy (SCMarker) to accurately delineate cell types in single cell RNA-sequencing data by identifying genes that have bi/multi-modally distributed expression levels and are co- or mutually-exclusively expressed with some other genes. Our method can determine the cell-type-discriminative markers without referencing to any known transcriptomic profiles or cell ontologies, and consistently achieves accurate cell-type-discriminative marker identification in a variety of scRNA-seq datasets.	1187	3.249828884325804	5	38	0	0	4.25

However, these methods often generate multiplet artifacts, where two or more cells receive the same barcode, resulting in a hybrid transcriptome. In most experiments, multiplets account for several percent of transcriptomes and can confound downstream data analysis. Here, we present Scrublet (Single-Cell Remover of Doublets), a framework for predicting the impact of multiplets in a given analysis and identifying problematic multiplets. Scrublet avoids the need for expert knowledge or cell clustering by simulating multiplets from the data and building a nearest neighbor classifier. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we test Scrublet on several datasets that include independent knowledge of cell multiplets.	1175	3.216974674880219	3	22	25	0.02127659574468085	71.65
10.1101/361980	FALSE	TRUE	McImpute: Matrix completion based imputation for single cell RNA-seq data	2018-07-05	Single cell RNA sequencing has been proved to be revolutionary for its potential of zooming into complex biological systems. Genome wide expression analysis at single cell resolution, provides a window into dynamics of cellular phenotypes. This facilitates characterization of transcriptional heterogeneity in normal and diseased tissues under various conditions. It also sheds light on development or emergence of specific cell populations and phenotypes. However, owing to the paucity of input RNA, a typical single cell RNA sequencing data features a high number of dropout events where transcripts fail to get amplified.We introduce mcImpute, a low-rank matrix completion based technique to impute dropouts in single cell expression data. On a number of real datasets, application of mcImpute yields significant improvements in separation of true zeros from dropouts, cell-clustering, differential expression analysis, cell type separability, performance of dimensionality reduction techniques for cell visualization and gene distribution.https://github.com/aanchalMongia/McImpute_scRNAseq	1179	3.2279260780287475	3	45	3	0.002544529262086514	11.93
10.1101/364166	FALSE	TRUE	Self-assembling Manifolds in Single-cell RNA Sequencing Data	2018-07-07	Single-cell RNA sequencing has spurred the development of computational methods that enable researchers to classify cell types, delineate developmental trajectories, and measure molecular responses to external perturbations. Many of these technologies rely on their ability to detect genes whose cell-to-cell variations arise from the biological processes of interest rather than transcriptional or technical noise. However, for datasets in which the biologically relevant differences between cells are subtle, identifying these genes is a challenging task. We present the self-assembling manifold (SAM) algorithm, an iterative soft feature selection strategy to quantify gene relevance and improve dimensionality reduction. We demonstrate its advantages over other state-of-the-art methods with experimental validation in identifying novel stem cell populations of Schistosoma, a prevalent parasite that infects hundreds of millions of people. Extending our analysis to a total of 56 datasets, we show that SAM is generalizable and consistently outperforms other methods in a variety of biological and quantitative benchmarks.	1177	3.2224503764544834	5	47	3	0.002548853016142736	10.33
10.1101/364810	FALSE	TRUE	DoubletDecon: Cell-State Aware Removal of Single-Cell RNA-Seq Doublets	2018-07-08	Methods for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) have greatly advanced in recent years. While droplet- and well-based methods have increased the capture frequency of cells for scRNA-Seq, these technologies readily produce technical artifacts, such as doublet-cell and multiplet-cell captures. Doublets occurring between distinct cell-types can appear as hybrid scRNA-Seq profiles, but do not have distinct transcriptomes from individual cell states. We introduce DoubletDecon, an approach that detects doublets with a combination of deconvolution analyses and the identification of unique cell-state gene expression. We demonstrate the ability of DoubletDecon to identify synthetic and cell-hashing cell singlets and doublets from scRNA-Seq datasets of varying cellular complexity. DoubletDecon is able to account for cell-cycle effects and is compatible with diverse species and unsupervised population detection algorithms (e.g., ICGS, Seurat). We believe this approach has the potential to become a standard quality control step for the accurate delineation of cell states.	1176	3.2197125256673513	7	18	15	0.012755102040816327	82.23
10.1101/365007	FALSE	TRUE	Deep learning for inferring gene relationships from single-cell expression data	2018-07-08	Several methods were developed to mine gene-gene relationships from expression data. Examples include correlation and mutual information methods for co-expression analysis, clustering and undirected graphical models for functional assignments and directed graphical models for pathway reconstruction. Using a novel encoding for gene expression data, followed by deep neural networks analysis, we present a framework that can successfully address all these diverse tasks. We show that our method, CNNC, improves upon prior methods in tasks ranging from predicting transcription factor targets to identifying disease related genes to causality inference. CNNC’s encoding provides insights about some of the decisions it makes and their biological basis. CNNC is flexible and can easily be extended to integrate additional types of genomics data leading to further improvements in its performance.Supporting website with software and data:https://github.com/xiaoyeye/CNNC.	1176	3.2197125256673513	2	41	6	0.00510204081632653	14.18
10.1101/367003	FALSE	TRUE	De novo Gene Signature Identification from Single-Cell RNA-Seq with Hierarchical Poisson Factorization	2018-07-11	Common approaches to gene signature discovery in single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) depend upon predefined structures like clusters or pseudo-temporal order, require prior normalization, or do not account for the sparsity of single cell data. We present single cell Hierarchical Poisson Factorization (scHPF), a Bayesian factorization method that adapts Hierarchical Poisson Factorization [1] forde novodiscovery of both continuous and discrete expression patterns from scRNA-seq. scHPF does not require prior normalization and captures statistical properties of single cell data better than other methods in benchmark datasets. Applied to scRNA-seq of the core and margin of a high-grade glioma, scHPF uncovers marked differences in the abundance of glioma subpopulations across tumor regions and subtle, regionally-associated expression biases within glioma subpopulations. scHFP revealed an expression signature that was spatially biased towards the glioma-infiltrated margins and associated with inferior survival in glioblastoma.	1173	3.2114989733059547	11	42	6	0.005115089514066497	13.78
10.1101/369538	FALSE	TRUE	scPred: Cell type prediction at single-cell resolution	2018-07-15	Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled the characterization of highly specific cell types in many human tissues, as well as both primary and stem cell-derived cell lines. An important facet of these studies is the ability to identify the transcriptional signatures that define a cell type or state. In theory, this information can be used to classify an unknown cell based on its transcriptional profile; and clearly, the ability to accurately predict a cell type and any pathologic-related state will play a critical role in the early diagnosis of disease and decisions around the personalized treatment for patients. Here we present a new generalizable method (scPred) for prediction of cell type(s), using a combination of unbiased feature selection from a reduced-dimension space, and machine-learning classification. scPred solves several problems associated with the identification of individual gene feature selection, and is able to capture subtle effects of many genes, increasing the overall variance explained by the model, and correspondingly improving the prediction accuracy. We validate the performance of scPred by performing experiments to classify tumor versus non-tumor epithelial cells in gastric cancer, then using independent molecular techniques (cyclic immunohistochemistry) to confirm our prediction, achieving an accuracy of classifying the disease state of individual cells of 99%. Moreover, we apply scPred to scRNA-seq data from pancreatic tissue, colorectal tumor biopsies, and circulating dendritic cells, and show that scPred is able to classify cell subtypes with an accuracy of 96.1-99.2%. Collectively, our results demonstrate the utility of scPred as a single cell prediction method that can be used for a wide variety of applications. The generalized method is implemented in software available here: https://github.com/IMB-Computational-Genomics-Lab/scPred/	1169	3.2005475701574264	5	46	13	0.011120615911035072	47.48
10.1101/371179	FALSE	TRUE	Panoramic stitching of heterogeneous single-cell transcriptomic data	2018-07-17	Researchers are generating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiles of diverse biological systems1–4 and every cell type in the human body.5 Leveraging this data to gain unprecedented insight into biology and disease will require assembling heterogeneous cell populations across multiple experiments, laboratories, and technologies. Although methods for scRNA-seq data integration exist6,7, they often naively merge data sets together even when the data sets have no cell types in common, leading to results that do not correspond to real biological patterns. Here we present Scanorama, inspired by algorithms for panorama stitching, that overcomes the limitations of existing methods to enable accurate, heterogeneous scRNA-seq data set integration. Our strategy identifies and merges the shared cell types among all pairs of data sets and is orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques. We use Scanorama to combine 105,476 cells from 26 diverse scRNA-seq experiments across 9 different technologies into a single comprehensive reference, demonstrating how Scanorama can be used to obtain a more complete picture of cellular function across a wide range of scRNA-seq experiments.	1167	3.1950718685831623	3	34	19	0.016281062553556127	125.364
10.1101/374025	FALSE	TRUE	ROSeq: A rank based approach to modeling gene expression in single cells	2018-07-22	1Systematic delineation of complex biological systems is an ever-challenging and resource-intensive process. Single cell transcriptomics allows us to study cell-to-cell variability in complex tissues at an unprecedented resolution. Accurate modeling of gene expression plays a critical role in the statistical determination of tissue-specific gene expression patterns. In the past few years, considerable efforts have been made to identify appropriate parametric models for single cell expression data. The zero-inflated version of Poisson/Negative Binomial and Log-Normal distributions have emerged as the most popular alternatives due to their ability to accommodate high dropout rates, as commonly observed in single cell data. While the majority of the parametric approaches directly model expression estimates, we explore the potential of modeling expression-ranks, as robust surrogates for transcript abundance. Here we examined the performance of the Discrete Generalized Beta Distribution (DGBD) on real data and devised a Wald-type test for comparing gene expression across two phenotypically divergent groups of single cells. We performed a comprehensive assessment of the proposed method, to understand its advantages as compared to some of the existing best practice approaches. Besides striking a reasonable balance between Type 1 and Type 2 errors, we concluded that ROSeq, the proposed differential expression test is exceptionally robust to expression noise and scales rapidly with increasing sample size. For wider dissemination and adoption of the method, we created an R package called ROSeq, and made it available on the Bioconductor platform.	1162	3.1813826146475015	8	24	1	8.605851979345956e-4	8.05

With this background, we propose CellFishing.jl, a new method for searching atlas-scale datasets for similar cells and detecting noteworthy genes of query cells with high accuracy and throughput. Using multiple scRNA-seq datasets, we validate that our method demonstrates comparable accuracy to and is markedly faster than the state-of-the-art software. Moreover, CellFishing.jl is scalable to more than one million cells, and the throughput of the search is approximately 1,600 cells per second.	1159	3.1731690622861053	4	50	1	8.628127696289905e-4	58.014
10.1101/375196	FALSE	TRUE	Scedar: a scalable Python package for single-cell RNA-seq exploratory data analysis	2018-07-23	In single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) experiments, the number of individual cells has increased exponentially, and the sequencing depth of each cell has decreased significantly. As a result, analyzing scRNA-seq data requires extensive considerations of program efficiency and method selection. In order to reduce the complexity of scRNA-seq data analysis, we present scedar, a scalable Python package for scRNA-seq exploratory data analysis. The package provides a convenient and reliable interface for performing visualization, imputation of gene dropouts, detection of rare transcriptomic profiles, and clustering on large-scale scRNA-seq datasets. The analytical methods are efficient, and they also do not assume that the data follow certain statistical distributions. The package is extensible and modular, which would facilitate the further development of functionalities for future requirements with the open-source development community.

10.1101/377762	FALSE	TRUE	The R package Rsubread is easier, faster, cheaper and better for alignment and quantification of RNA sequencing reads	2018-07-26	The first steps in the analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data are usually to map the reads to a reference genome and then to count reads by gene, by exon or by exon-exon junction. These two steps are at once the most common and also typically the most expensive computational steps in an RNA-seq analysis. These steps are typically undertaken using Unix command-line or Python software tools, even when downstream analysis is to be undertaken using R.We present Rsubread, a Bioconductor software package that provides high-performance alignment and counting functions for RNA-seq reads. Rsubread provides the ease-of-use of the R programming environment, creating a matrix of read counts directly as an R object ready for downstream analysis. It has no software dependencies other than R itself. Using SEQC data and simulations, we compare Rsubread to the popular non-R tools TopHat2, STAR and HTSeq. We also compare to counting functions provided in the Bioconductor infrastructure packages. We show that Rsubread is faster, uses less memory and produces read count summaries that more accurately correlate with true values. The results show that users can adopt the R environment for alignment and quantification without suffering any loss of performance.	1158	3.1704312114989732	3	29	16	0.013816925734024179	52.35
10.1101/378646	FALSE	TRUE	SymSim: simulating multi-faceted variability in single cell RNA sequencing	2018-07-28	The abundance of new computational methods for processing and interpreting transcriptomes at a single cell level raises the need for in-silico platforms for evaluation and validation. Simulated datasets which resemble the properties of real datasets can aid in method development and prioritization as well as in questions in experimental design by providing an objective ground truth. Here, we present SymSim, a simulator software that explicitly models the processes that give rise to data observed in single cell RNA-Seq experiments. The components of the SymSim pipeline pertain to the three primary sources of variation in single cell RNA-Seq data: noise intrinsic to the process of transcription, extrinsic variation that is indicative of different cell states (both discrete and continuous), and technical variation due to low sensitivity and measurement noise and bias. Unlike other simulators, the parameters that govern the simulation process directly represent meaningful properties such as mRNA capture rate, the number of PCR cycles, sequencing depth, or the use of unique molecular identifiers. We demonstrate how SymSim can be used for benchmarking methods for clustering and differential expression and for examining the effects of various parameters on their performance. We also show how SymSim can be used to evaluate the number of cells required to detect a rare population and how this number deviates from the theoretical lower bound as the quality of the data decreases. SymSim is publicly available as an R package and allows users to simulate datasets with desired properties or matched with experimental data.	1156	3.164955509924709	3	45	5	0.004325259515570935	22.05
10.1101/379883	FALSE	TRUE	PBLR: an accurate single cell RNA-seq data imputation tool considering cell heterogeneity and prior expression level of dropouts	2018-07-30	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a powerful tool to determine precise expression patterns of tens of thousands of individual cells, decipher cell heterogeneity and cell subpopulations and so on. However, scRNA-seq data analysis remains challenging due to various technical noise, e.g., the presence of dropout events (i.e., excess zero counts). Taking account of cell heterogeneity and structural effect of expression on dropout rate, we propose a novel method named PBLR to accurately impute the dropouts of scRNA-seq data. PBLR is an effective tool to recover dropout events on both simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets, and can dramatically improve low-dimensional representation and recovery of gene-gene relationship masked by dropout events compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, PBLR also detect accurate and robust cell subpopulations automatically, shedding light its flexibility and generality for scRNA-seq data analysis.	1154	3.159479808350445	2	39	6	0.005199306759098787	4.75

The first, often referred to as pseudotime ordering methods, are deterministic and rely on dimensionality reduction followed by an ordering step. The second learns a probabilistic branching model to represent the developmental process. While both types have been successful, each suffers from shortcomings that can impact their accuracy.We developed a new method based on continuous state HMMs (CSHMMs) for representing and modeling time series scRNA-Seq data. We define the CSHMM model and provide efficient learning and inference algorithms which allow the method to determine both the structure of the branching process and the assignment of cells to these branches. Analyzing several developmental single cell datasets we show that the CSHMM method accurately infers branching topology and correctly and continuously assign cells to paths, improving upon prior methods proposed for this task.

The marked technical variability and high amounts of missing observations typical of scRNA-seq datasets make this task particularly challenging. Here, we introduce bayNorm, a novel Bayesian approach for scaling and inference of scRNA-seq counts. The method’s likelihood function follows a binomial model of mRNA capture, while priors are estimated from expression values across cells using an empirical Bayes approach. We demonstrate using publicly-available scRNA-seq datasets and simulated expression data that bayNorm allows robust imputation of missing values generating realistic transcript distributions that match single molecule FISH measurements. Moreover, by using priors informed by dataset structures, bayNorm improves accuracy and sensitivity of differential expression analysis and reduces batch effect compared to other existing methods. Altogether, bayNorm provides an efficient, integrated solution for global scaling normalisation, imputation and true count recovery of gene expression measurements from scRNA-seq data.	1150	3.1485284052019167	7	80	7	0.00608695652173913	22.48

Here we present Palantir, an algorithm that models trajectories of differentiating cells, which treats cell-fate as a probabilistic process, and leverages entropy to measure the changing nature of cell plasticity along the differentiation trajectory. Palantir generates a high resolution pseudotime ordering of cells, and assigns each cell state with its probability to differentiate into each terminal state. We apply Palantir to human bone marrow scRNA-seq data and detect key landmarks of hematopoietic differentiation. Palantir’s resolution enables identification of key transcription factors driving lineage fate choices, as these TFs closely track when cells lose plasticity. We demonstrate that Palantir is generalizable to diverse tissue types and well-suited to resolve less studied differentiating systems.	1148	3.143052703627652	6	72	9	0.0078397212543554	36.514

We present BRAPeS, an algorithm for reconstructing BCRs from short-read paired-end single cell RNA-sequencing. BRAPeS is accurate and achieves a high success rate even at very short (25bp) read length, which can decrease the cost and increase the number of cells that can be analyzed compared to long reads.

Augmenting few real observations with generated in silico samples could lead to more robust analysis results and a higher reproducibility rate. Here we propose the use of conditional single cell Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (cscGANs) for the realistic generation of single cell RNA-seq data. cscGANs learn non-linear gene-gene dependencies from complex, multi cell type samples and use this information to generate realistic cells of defined types. Augmenting sparse cell populations with cscGAN generated cells improves downstream analyses such as the detection of marker genes, the robustness and reliability of classifiers, the assessment of novel analysis algorithms, and might reduce the number of animal experiments and costs in consequence. cscGANs outperform existing methods for single cell RNA-seq data generation in quality and hold great promise for the realistic generation and augmentation of other biomedical data types.	1140	3.1211498973305956	7	33	9	0.007894736842105263	21.23

Despite the advances of many clustering methods, there are few tailored methods for population-scale scRNA-seq studies. Here, we have developed a BAyesiany Mixture Model for Single Cell sequencing (BAMM-SC) method to cluster scRNA-seq data from multiple individuals simultaneously. Specifically, BAMM-SC takes raw data as input and can account for data heterogeneity and batch effect among multiple individuals in a unified Bayesian hierarchical model framework. Results from extensive simulations and application of BAMM-SC to in-house scRNA-seq datasets using blood, lung and skin cells from humans or mice demonstrated that BAMM-SC outperformed existing clustering methods with improved clustering accuracy and reduced impact from batch effects. BAMM-SC has been implemented in a user-friendly R package with a detailed tutorial available on www.pitt.edu/~Cwec47/singlecell.html.	1137	3.1129363449691994	14	21	0	0	1.5

However, such integrative analyses are challenging and require sophisticated methodologies. To enable effective interrogation of multiple scRNA-Seq datasets, we have developed a novel algorithm, named scMerge, that removes unwanted variation by combining stably expressed genes and utilizing pseudo-replicates across datasets.

10.1101/396135	FALSE	TRUE	Determination of essential phenotypic elements of clusters in high-dimensional entities - DEPECHE	2018-08-20	Technological advances have facilitated an exponential increase in the amount of information that can be derived from single cells, necessitating new computational tools that can make this highly complex data interpretable. Here, we introduce DEPECHE, a rapid, parameter free, sparse k-means-based algorithm for clustering of multi-and megavariate single-cell data. In a number of computational benchmarks aimed at evaluating the capacity to form biologically relevant clusters, including flow/mass-cytometry and single cell RNA sequencing data sets with manually curated gold standard solutions, DEPECHE clusters as well or better as the best performing state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. However, the main advantage of DEPECHE, compared to the state-of-the-art, is its unique ability to enhance interpretability of the formed clusters, in that it only retains variables relevant for cluster separation, thereby facilitating computational efficient analyses as well as understanding of complex datasets. An open source R implementation of DEPECHE is available at https://github.com/theorell/DepecheR.DEPECHE-a data-mining algorithm for mega-variate dataModern experimental technologies facilitate an array of single cells measurements, e.g. at the RNA-level, generating enormous datasets with thousands of annotated biological markers for each of thousands of cells. To analyze such datasets, researchers routinely apply automated or semi-automated techniques to order the cells into biologically relevant groups. However, even after such groups have been generated, it is often difficult to interpret the biological meaning of these groups since the definition of each group often dependends on thousands of biological markers. Therefore, in this article, we introduce DEPECHE, an algorithm designed to simultaneously group cells and enhance interpretability of the formed groups. DEPECHE defines groups only with respect to biological markers that contribute significantly to differentiate the cells in the group from the rest of the cells, yielding more succinct group definitions. Using the open source R software DepecheR on RNA sequencing data and mass cytometry data, the number of defining markers were reduced up to 1000-fold, thereby increasing interpretability vastly, while maintaining or improving the biological relevance of the groups formed compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.	1133	3.1019849418206706	3	24	0	0	11.58

Therefore, efficient computational tools for combining diverse datasets are crucial for biology in the single cell genomics era. A number of methods have been developed to assist data integration by removing technical batch effects, but most are computationally intensive. To overcome the challenge of enormous datasets, we have developed BBKNN, an extremely fast graph-based data integration method. We illustrate the power of BBKNN for dimensionalityreduced visualisation and clustering in multiple biological scenarios, including a massive integrative study over several murine atlases. BBKNN successfully connects cell populations across experimentally heterogeneous mouse scRNA-Seq datasets, which reveals global markers of cell type and organspecificity and provides the foundation for inferring the underlying transcription factor network.

We present a method based on low-rank approximation which successfully replaces these dropouts (zero expression levels of unobserved expressed genes) by nonzero values, while preserving biologically non-expressed genes (true biological zeros) at zero expression levels. We validate our approach and compare it to two state-of-the-art methods. We show that it recovers true expression of marker genes while preserving biological zeros, increases separation of known cell types and improves correlation of simulated cells to their true profiles. Furthermore, our method is dramatically more scalable, allowing practitioners to quickly and easily recover expression of even the largest scRNA-seq datasets.	1131	3.0965092402464065	3	34	51	0.04509283819628647	14.45
10.1101/401943	FALSE	TRUE	Cell lineage inference from SNP and scRNA-Seq data	2018-08-30	Several recent studies focus on the inference of developmental and response trajectories from single cell NA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data. A number of computational methods, often referred to as pseudo-time ordering, have been developed for this task. Recently, CRISPR has also been used to reconstruct lineage trees by inserting random mutations. However, both approaches suffer from drawbacks that limit their use. Here we develop a method to detect significant, cell type specific, sequence mutations from scRNA-Seq data. We show that only a few mutations are enough for reconstructing good branching models. Integrating these mutations with expression data further improves the accuracy of the reconstructed models. As we show, the majority of mutations we identify are likely RNA editing events indicating that such information can be used to distinguish cell types.	1123	3.07460643394935	3	46	3	0.0026714158504007124	17.884

VISION operates directly on the manifold of cell-cell similarity and employs a flexible annotation approach that can operate either with or without preconceived stratification of the cells into groups or along a continuum. We demonstrate the utility of VISION using a relatively homogeneous set of B cells from a cohort of lupus patients and healthy controls and show that it can derive important sources of cellular variation and link them to clinical phenotypes in a stratification free manner. VISION produces an interactive, low latency and feature rich web-based report that can be easily shared amongst researchers.	1124	3.077344284736482	6	52	6	0.005338078291814947	17.03
10.1101/409961	FALSE	TRUE	QUBIC2: A novel biclustering algorithm for large-scale bulk RNA-sequencing and single-cell RNA-sequencing data analysis	2018-09-07	The combination of biclustering and large-scale gene expression data holds a promising potential for inference of the condition specific functional pathways/networks. However, existing biclustering tools do not have satisfied performance on high-resolution RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) data, majorly due to the lack of (i) a consideration of high sparsity of RNA-Seq data, e.g., the massive zeros or lowly expressed genes in the data, especially for single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data, and (ii) an understanding of the underlying transcriptional regulation signals of the observed gene expression values. Here we presented a novel biclustering algorithm namely QUBIC2, for the analysis of large-scale bulk RNA-Seq and scRNA-Seq data. Key novelties of the algorithm include (i) used a truncated model to handle the unreliable quantification of genes with low or moderate expression, (ii) adopted the mixture Gaussian distribution and an information-divergency objective function to capture shared transcriptional regulation signals among a set of genes, (iii) utilized a Core-Dual strategy to identify biclusters and optimize relevant parameters, and (iv) developed a size-based P-value framework to evaluate the statistical significances of all the identified biclusters. Our method validation on comprehensive data sets of bulk and single cell RNA-seq data suggests that QUBIC2 had superior performance in functional modules detection and cell type classification compared with the other five widely-used biclustering tools. In addition, the applications of temporal and spatial data demonstrated that QUBIC2 can derive meaningful biological information from scRNA-Seq data.

10.1101/412080	FALSE	TRUE	cellHarmony: Cell-level matching and holistic comparison of single-cell transcriptomes	2018-09-08	To understand the molecular pathogenesis of human disease, precision analyses to define molecular alterations within (and between) disease-associated cell populations are desperately needed. Single-cell genomics represents an ideal platform to enable the identification and comparison of normal and diseased transcriptional cell states. We note that disease-associated perturbations usually retain cellular-identity programs (core genes), providing an appropriate reference for secondary comparison analyses. Thus, we created cellHarmony, an integrated solution for the unsupervised analysis and classification of cell types from diverse scRNA-Seq datasets. cellHarmony is an automated and easy-to-use tool that efficiently matches single-cell transcriptomes using a community clustering and alignment strategy. Utilizing core genes and community clustering to reveal disease and cell-state systems-level insights overcomes bias toward donor and disease effects that can be imposed by joint-alignment approaches. Moreover, cellHarmony directly compares cell frequencies and gene expression in a cell-type-specific manner, then produces a holistic representation of these differences across potentially dozens of cell populations and impacted regulatory networks. Using this approach, we identify gene regulatory programs that are selectively impacted in distinct hematopoietic and heart cell populations that suggest novel disease mechanisms and drug targets. Thus, this approach holds tremendous promise in revealing the molecular and cellular origins of complex diseases.	1114	3.049965776865161	9	39	3	0.0026929982046678637	14.984

DNA-sequencing, either using bulk or using single-cell assays, has enabled the reconstruction of clonal trees from frequency and co-occurrence patterns of somatic variants. However, approaches to systematically characterize phenotypic and functional variations between individual clones are not established. Here we present cardelino (https://github.com/PMBio/cardelino), a computational method for inferring the clone of origin of individual cells that have been assayed using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). After validating our model using simulations, we apply cardelino to matched scRNA-seq and exome sequencing data from 32 human dermal fibroblast lines, identifying hundreds of differentially expressed genes between cells from different somatic clones. These genes are frequently enriched for cell cycle and proliferation pathways, indicating a key role for cell division genes in non-neutral somatic evolution.A novel approach for integrating DNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq data to reconstruct clonal substructure for single-cell transcriptomes.Evidence for non-neutral evolution of clonal populations in human fibroblasts.Proliferation and cell cycle pathways are commonly distorted in mutated clonal populations.	1112	3.0444900752908968	13	70	13	0.011690647482014389	59.48
10.1101/416719	FALSE	TRUE	SuperCT: A supervised-learning-framework to enhance the characterization of single-cell transcriptomic profiles	2018-09-16	Characterization of individual cell types is fundamental to the study of multicellular samples such as tumor tissues. Single-cell RNAseq techniques, which allow high-throughput expression profiling of individual cells, have significantly advanced our ability of this task. Currently, most of the scRNA-seq data analyses are commenced with unsupervised clustering of cells followed by visualization of clusters in a low-dimensional space. Clusters are often assigned to different cell types based on canonical markers. However, the efficiency of characterizing the known cell types in this way is low and limited by the investigator[s] knowledge. In this study, we present a technical framework of training the expandable supervised-classifier in order to reveal the single-cell identities based on their RNA expression profiles. Using multiple scRNA-seq datasets we demonstrate the superior accuracy, robustness, compatibility and expandability of this new solution compared to the traditional methods. We use two examples of model upgrade to demonstrate how the projected evolution of the cell-type classifier is realized.	1106	3.028062970568104	9	14	0	0	11.434
10.1101/421354	FALSE	TRUE	Dissecting heterogeneous cell populations across drug and disease conditions with PopAlign	2018-09-21	Single-cell measurement techniques can now probe gene expression in heterogeneous cell populations from the human body across a range of environmental and physiological conditions. However, new mathematical and computational methods are required to represent and analyze gene expression changes that occur in complex mixtures of single cells as they respond to signals, drugs, or disease states. Here, we introduce a mathematical modeling platform, PopAlign, that automatically identifies subpopulations of cells within a heterogeneous mixture, and tracks gene expression and cell abundance changes across subpopulations by constructing and comparing probabilistic models. Probabilistic models provide a low-error, compressed representation of single cell data that enables efficient large-scale computations. We apply PopAlign to analyze the impact of 40 different immunomodulatory compounds on a heterogeneous population of donor-derived human immune cells as well as patient-specific disease signatures in multiple myeloma. PopAlign scales to comparisons involving tens to hundreds of samples, enabling large-scale studies of natural and engineered cell populations as they respond to drugs, signals or physiological change.	1101	3.0143737166324436	8	46	2	0.0018165304268846503	40.25
10.1101/426239	FALSE	TRUE	Quasi-universality in single-cell sequencing data	2018-10-05	The development of single-cell technologies provides the opportunity to identify new cellular states and reconstruct novel cell-to-cell relationships. Applications range from understanding the transcriptional and epigenetic processes involved in metazoan development to characterizing distinct cells types in heterogeneous populations like cancers or immune cells. However, analysis of the data is impeded by its unknown intrinsic biological and technical variability together with its sparseness; these factors complicate the identification of true biological signals amidst artifact and noise. Here we show that, across technologies, roughly 95% of the eigenvalues derived from each single-cell data set can be described by universal distributions predicted by Random Matrix Theory. Interestingly, 5% of the spectrum shows deviations from these distributions and present a phenomenon known as eigenvector localization, where information tightly concentrates in groups of cells. Some of the localized eigenvectors reflect underlying biological signal, and some are simply a consequence of the sparsity of single cell data; roughly 3% is artifactual. Based on the universal distributions and a technique for detecting sparsity induced localization, we present a strategy to identify the residual 2% of directions that encode biological information and thereby denoise single-cell data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by comparing with standard single-cell data analysis techniques in a variety of examples with marked cell populations.	1087	2.976043805612594	4	74	2	0.0018399264029438822	13.78

Here, we present Scribe, a toolkit for detecting and visualizing causal regulatory interactions between genes and explore the potential for single-cell experiments to power network reconstruction. Scribe employs Restricted Directed Information to determine causality by estimating the strength of information transferred from a potential regulator to its downstream target. We apply Scribe and other leading approaches for causal network reconstruction to several types of single-cell measurements and show that there is a dramatic drop in performance for ""pseudotime” ordered single-cell data compared to true time series data. We demonstrate that performing causal inference requires temporal coupling between measurements. We show that methods such as “RNA velocity” restore some degree of coupling through an analysis of chromaffin cell fate commitment. These analyses therefore highlight an important shortcoming in experimental and computational methods for analyzing gene regulation at single-cell resolution and point the way towards overcoming it."	1097	3.0034223134839153	9	69	13	0.011850501367365542	89.35

Here, we profile transcriptomes of ∼50,000 single cells from this unique microenvironment, sampling matched first trimester maternal blood and decidua, and fetal cells from the placenta itself. We define the cellular composition of human decidua, revealing five distinct subsets of decidual fibroblasts with differing growth factors and hormone production profiles, and show that fibroblast states define two distinct decidual layers. Among decidual NK cells, we resolve three subsets, each with a different immunomodulatory and chemokine profile. We develop a repository of ligand-receptor pairs (www.CellPhoneDB.org) and a statistical tool to predict the probability of cell-cell interactions via these pairs, highlighting specific interactions between decidual NK cells and invading fetal extravillous trophoblast cells, maternal immune and stromal cells. Our single cell atlas of the maternal-fetal interface reveals the cellular organization and interactions critical for placentation and reproductive success.	1093	2.9924709103353866	21	65	1	9.149130832570906e-4	47.584
10.1101/430009	FALSE	TRUE	LTMG: A novel statistical modeling of transcriptional expression states in single-cell RNA-Seq data	2018-09-29	A key challenge in modeling single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data is to capture the diverse gene expression states regulated by different transcriptional regulatory inputs across single cells, which is further complicated by a large number of observed zero and low expressions. We developed a left truncated mixture Gaussian (LTMG) model that stems from the kinetic relationships between the transcriptional regulatory inputs and metabolism of mRNA and gene expression abundance in a cell. LTMG infers the expression multi-modalities across single cell entities, representing a gene’s diverse expression states; meanwhile the dropouts and low expressions are treated as left truncated, specifically representing an expression state that is under suppression. We demonstrated that LTMG has significantly better goodness of fitting on an extensive number of single-cell data sets, comparing to three other state of the art models. In addition, our systems kinetic approach of handling the low and zero expressions and correctness of the identified multimodality are validated on several independent experimental data sets. Application on data of complex tissues demonstrated the capability of LTMG in extracting varied expression states specific to cell types or cell functions. Based on LTMG, a differential gene expression test and a co-regulation module identification method, namely LTMG-DGE and LTMG-GCR, are further developed. We experimentally validated that LTMG-DGE is equipped with higher sensitivity and specificity in detecting differentially expressed genes, compared with other five popular methods, and that LTMG-GCR is capable to retrieve the gene co-regulation modules corresponding to perturbed transcriptional regulations.

10.1101/430967	FALSE	TRUE	rCASC: reproducible Classification Analysis of Single Cell sequencing data	2018-10-03	Single-cell RNA sequencing has emerged as an essential tool to investigate cellular heterogeneity, and highlighting cell sub-population specific signatures.

This has led to an explosion of tailored analysis methods for scRNA-seq data to address various biological questions. However, the current lack of gold-standard benchmark datasets makes it difficult for researchers to systematically evaluate the performance of the many methods available. Here, we designed and carried out a realistic benchmark experiment that included mixtures of single cells or ‘pseudo cells’ created by sampling admixtures of cells or RNA from up to 5 distinct cancer cell lines. Altogether we generated 14 datasets using droplet and plate-based scRNA-seq protocols, compared multiple data analysis methods in combination for tasks ranging from normalization and imputation, to clustering, trajectory analysis and data integration. Evaluation across 3,913 analyses (methods × benchmark dataset combinations) revealed pipelines suited to different types of data for different tasks. Our dataset and analysis present a comprehensive comparison framework for benchmarking most common scRNA-seq analysis tasks.	1089	2.9815195071868583	12	53	11	0.010101010101010102	85.28
10.1101/434746	FALSE	TRUE	Mutation detection in thousands of acute myeloid leukemia cells using single cell RNA-sequencing	2018-10-17	Virtually all tumors are genetically heterogeneous, containing subclonal populations of cells that are defined by distinct mutations1. Subclones can have unique phenotypes that influence disease progression2, but these phenotypes are difficult to characterize: subclones usually cannot be physically purified, and bulk gene expression measurements obscure interclonal differences. Single-cell RNA-sequencing has revealed transcriptional heterogeneity within a variety of tumor types, but it is unclear how this expression heterogeneity relates to subclonal genetic events – for example, whether particular expression clusters correspond to mutationally defined subclones3,4,5,6-9. To address this question, we developed an approach that integrates enhanced whole genome sequencing (eWGS) with the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 5’ Gene Expression workflow (scRNA-seq) to directly link expressed mutations with transcriptional profiles at single cell resolution. Using bone marrow samples from five cases of primary human Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), we generated WGS and scRNA-seq data for each case. Duplicate single cell libraries representing a median of 20,474 cells per case were generated from the bone marrow of each patient. Although the libraries were 5’ biased, we detected expressed mutations in cDNAs at distances up to 10 kbp from the 5’ ends of well-expressed genes, allowing us to identify hundreds to thousands of cells with AML-specific somatic mutations in every case. This data made it possible to distinguish AML cells (including normal-karyotype AML cells) from surrounding normal cells, to study tumor differentiation and intratumoral expression heterogeneity, to identify expression signatures associated with subclonal mutations, and to find cell surface markers that could be used to purify subclones for further study. The data also revealed transcriptional heterogeneity that occurred independently of subclonal mutations, suggesting that additional factors drive epigenetic heterogeneity. This integrative approach for connecting genotype to phenotype in AML cells is broadly applicable for analysis of any sample that is phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous.	1075	2.943189596167009	10	30	4	0.0037209302325581397	57.5
10.1101/437095	FALSE	TRUE	A statistical simulator scDesign for rational scRNA-seq experimental design	2018-10-07	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized biological sciences by revealing genome-wide gene expression levels within individual cells. However, a critical challenge faced by researchers is how to optimize the choices of sequencing platforms, sequencing depths, and cell numbers in designing scRNA-seq experiments, so as to balance the exploration of the depth and breadth of transcriptome information.Here we present a flexible and robust simulator, scDesign, the first statistical framework for researchers to quantitatively assess practical scRNA-seq experimental design in the context of differential gene expression analysis. In addition to experimental design, scDesign also assists computational method development by generating high-quality synthetic scRNA-seq datasets under customized experimental settings. In an evaluation based on 17 cell types and six different protocols, scDesign outperformed four state-of-the-art scRNA-seq simulation methods and led to rational experimental design. In addition, scDesign demonstrates reproducibility across biological replicates and independent studies. We also discuss the performance of multiple differential expression and dimension reduction methods based on the protocol-dependent scRNA-seq data generated by scDesign. scDesign is expected to be an effective bioinformatic tool that assists rational scRNA-seq experiment design based on specific research goals and compares various scRNA-seq computational methods.We have implemented our method in the R package scDesign, which is freely available at https://github.com/Vivianstats/scDesign.jli@stat.ucla.edu	1085	2.97056810403833	2	53	0	0	12.18

We develop a methodology that addresses scRNA-seq’s sparsity through partitioning the data into metacells: disjoint, homogenous and highly compact groups of cells, each exhibiting only sampling variance. Metacells constitute local building blocks for clustering and quantitative analysis of gene expression, while not enforcing any global structure on the data, thereby maintaining statistical control and minimizing biases. We illustrate the MetaCell framework by re-analyzing cell type and transcriptional gradients in peripheral blood and whole organism scRNA-seq maps. Our algorithms are implemented in the new MetaCell R/C++ software package.	1084	2.967830253251198	9	47	11	0.01014760147601476	30.73
10.1101/444687	FALSE	TRUE	High throughput droplet single-cell Genotyping of Transcriptomes (GoT) reveals the cell identity dependency of the impact of somatic mutations	2018-10-16	Defining the transcriptomic identity of clonally related malignant cells is challenging in the absence of cell surface markers that distinguish cancer clones from one another or from admixed non-neoplastic cells. While single-cell methods have been devised to capture both the transcriptome and genotype, these methods are not compatible with droplet-based single-cell transcriptomics, limiting their throughput. To overcome this limitation, we present single-cell Genotyping of Transcriptomes (GoT), which integrates cDNA genotyping with high-throughput droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq. We further demonstrate that multiplexed GoT can interrogate multiple genotypes for distinguishing subclonal transcriptomic identity. We apply GoT to 26,039 CD34+ cells across six patients with myeloid neoplasms, in which the complex process of hematopoiesis is corrupted by CALR-mutated stem and progenitor cells. We define high-resolution maps of malignant versus normal hematopoietic progenitors, and show that while mutant cells are comingled with wildtype cells throughout the hematopoietic progenitor landscape, their frequency increases with differentiation. We identify the unfolded protein response as a predominant outcome of CALR mutations, with significant cell identity dependency. Furthermore, we identify that CALR mutations lead to NF-κB pathway upregulation specifically in uncommitted early stem cells. Collectively, GoT provides high-throughput linkage of single-cell genotypes with transcriptomes and reveals that the transcriptional output of somatic mutations is heavily dependent on the native cell identity.	1076	2.945927446954141	19	73	5	0.004646840148698885	44

Current analytical workflows are driven by categorizing principles that consider cells as individual entities and classify them into complex taxonomies. We have devised a conceptually different computational framework based on a holistic view, where single-cell datasets are used to infer global, large-scale regulatory networks. We developed correlation metrics that are specifically tailored to single-cell data, and then generated, validated and interpreted single-cell-derived regulatory networks from organs and perturbed systems, such as diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. Using advanced tools from graph theory, we computed an unbiased quantification of a gene’s biological relevance, and accurately pinpointed key players in organ function and drivers of diseases. Our approach detected multiple latent regulatory changes that are invisible to single-cell workflows based on clustering or differential expression analysis. In summary, we have established the feasibility and value of regulatory network analysis using scRNA-seq datasets, which significantly broadens the biological insights that can be obtained with this leading technology.	1075	2.943189596167009	3	54	1	9.302325581395349e-4	24.95
10.1101/455436	FALSE	TRUE	Embedding single-cell experimental conditions to reveal manifold structure of cancer drug perturbation effects	2018-10-29	Previously, the effect of a drug on a cell population was measured based on simple metrics such as cell viability. However, as single-cell technologies are becoming more advanced, drug screen experiments can now be conducted with more complex readouts such as gene expression profiles of individual cells. The increasing complexity of measurements from these multi-sample experiments calls for more sophisticated analytical approaches than are currently available. We developed a novel method called PhEMD (Phenotypic Earth Mover’s Distance) and show that it can be used to embed the space of drug perturbations on the basis of the drugs’ effects on cell populations. When testing PhEMD on a newly-generated, 300-sample CyTOF kinase inhibition screen experiment, we find that the state space of the perturbation conditions is surprisingly low-dimensional and that the network of drugs demonstrates manifold structure. We show that because of the fairly simple manifold geometry of the 300 samples, we can accurately capture the full range of drug effects using a dictionary of only 30 experimental conditions. We also show that new drugs can be added to our PhEMD embedding using similarities inferred from other characterizations of drugs using a technique called Nystrom extension. Our findings suggest that large-scale drug screens can be conducted by measuring only a small fraction of the drugs using the most expensive high-throughput single-cell technologies—the effects of other drugs may be inferred by mapping and extending the perturbation space. We additionally show that PhEMD can be useful for analyzing other types of single-cell samples, such as patient tumor biopsies, by mapping the patient state space in a similar way as the drug state space. We demonstrate that PhEMD is scalable, compatible with leading batch effect correction techniques, and generalizable to multiple experimental designs. Altogether, our analyses suggest that PhEMD may facilitate drug discovery efforts and help uncover the network geometry of a collection of single-cell samples.	1063	2.9103353867214237	6	68	0	0	13.05

To address this challenge, we have developed Moana, a hierarchical machine learning framework that enables the construction of robust cell type classifiers from heterogeneous scRNA-Seq datasets. To demonstrate Moana’s capabilities, we construct cell type classifiers for human immune cells that accurately distinguish between closely related cell types in the presence of experimental perturbations and systematic differences between scRNA-Seq protocols. We show that Moana is generally applicable and scales to datasets with more than ten thousand cells, thus enabling the construction of tissue-specific cell type atlases that can be directly applied to analyze new scRNASeq datasets. A Python implementation of Moana can be found at https://github.com/yanailab/moana.	1062	2.9075975359342916	2	33	34	0.032015065913371	55.684

Dozens of software packages have been developed and different labs tend to have different preferences on choices of the workflow. Such diversity can cause difficulties in future efforts of aggregating data from multiple labs, and also difficulties for new labs to start in this field. A few pipelines have been developed to help integrating multiple steps into a whole, but the fixed software architecture makes it hard for developers to add new features or exchange parts in the pipeline.We presented SIP, a Single-cell Interchangeable Pipeline. It is a one-stop platform for the processing of scRNA-seq data from multiple platforms, and will also support for other types of data like scATAC-seq data. SIP utilizes container technology to solve the deployment dilemma when handling multiple packages and provides an easy-to-use interface for users to conduct the complicated multi-step process from raw data to final results with a single command. It also allows advanced users to assemble different versions of the pipeline by interchanging parts or adding new modules.

10.1101/457622	FALSE	TRUE	Genetic Heterogeneity Profiling by Single Cell RNA Sequencing	2018-10-30	Detection of genetically distinct subclones and profiling the transcriptomic differences between them is important for studying the evolutionary dynamics of tumors, as well as for accurate prognosis and effective treatment of cancer in the clinic. For the profiling of intra-tumor transcriptional heterogeneity, single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is now ubiquitously adopted in ongoing and planned cancer studies. Detection of somatic DNA mutations and inference of clonal membership from scRNA-seq, however, is currently unreliable. We propose DENDRO, an analysis method for scRNA-seq data that detects genetically distinct subclones, assigns each single cell to a subclone, and reconstructs the phylogenetic tree describing the tumor’s evolutionary history. DENDRO utilizes information from single nucleotide mutations in transcribed regions and accounts for technical noise and expression stochasticity at the single cell level. The accuracy of DENDRO was benchmarked on spike-in datasets and on scRNA-seq data with known subpopulation structure. We applied DENDRO to delineate subclonal expansion in a mouse melanoma model in response to immunotherapy, highlighting the role of neoantigens in treatment response. We also applied DENDRO to primary and lymph-node metastasis samples in breast cancer, where the new approach allowed us to better understand the relationship between genetic and transcriptomic intratumor variation.	1062	2.9075975359342916	4	72	1	9.416195856873823e-4	8.65

10.1101/459404	FALSE	TRUE	scRMD: Imputation for single cell RNA-seq data via robust matrix decomposition	2018-11-04	Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables whole transcriptome profiling at single cell resolution and holds great promises in many biological and medical applications. Nevertheless, scRNA-seq often fails to capture expressed genes, leading to the prominent dropout problem. These dropouts cause many problems in down-stream analysis, such as significant noise increase, power loss in differential expression analysis and obscuring of gene-to-gene or cell-to-cell relationship. Imputation of these dropout values thus becomes an essential step in scRNA-seq data analysis.In this paper, we model the dropout imputation problem as robust matrix decomposition. This model has minimal assumptions and allows us to develop a computational efficient imputation method scRMD. Extensive data analysis shows that scRMD can accurately recover the dropout values and help to improve downstream analysis such as differential expression analysis and clustering analysis.ruibinxi@math.pku.edu.cn	1057	2.8939082819986313	6	36	6	0.005676442762535478	4.5
10.1101/459891	FALSE	TRUE	Integrative inference of brain cell similarities and differences from single-cell genomics	2018-11-02	Defining cell types requires integrating diverse measurements from multiple experiments and biological contexts. Recent technological developments in single-cell analysis have enabled high-throughput profiling of gene expression, epigenetic regulation, and spatial relationships amongst cells in complex tissues, but computational approaches that deliver a sensitive and specific joint analysis of these datasets are lacking. We developed LIGER, an algorithm that delineates shared and dataset-specific features of cell identity, allowing flexible modeling of highly heterogeneous single-cell datasets. We demonstrated its broad utility by applying it to four diverse and challenging analyses of human and mouse brain cells. First, we defined both cell-type-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression in the mouse bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, an anatomically complex brain region that plays important roles in sex-specific behaviors. Second, we analyzed gene expression in the substantia nigra of seven postmortem human subjects, comparing cell states in specific donors, and relating cell types to those in the mouse. Third, we jointly leveraged in situ gene expression and scRNA-seq data to spatially locate fine subtypes of cells present in the mouse frontal cortex. Finally, we integrated mouse cortical scRNA-seq profiles with single-cell DNA methylation signatures, revealing mechanisms of cell-type-specific gene regulation. Integrative analyses using the LIGER algorithm promise to accelerate single-cell investigations of cell-type definition, gene regulation, and disease states.	1059	2.8993839835728954	6	71	12	0.0113314447592068	51.25
10.1101/460147	FALSE	TRUE	Comprehensive integration of single cell data	2018-11-02	Single cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) has transformed our ability to discover and annotate cell types and states, but deep biological understanding requires more than a taxonomic listing of clusters. As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, including high-dimensional immunophenotypes, chromatin accessibility, and spatial positioning, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these datasets into a harmonized atlas that can be used to better understand cellular identity and function. Here, we develop a computational strategy to “anchor” diverse datasets together, enabling us to integrate and compare single cell measurements not only across scRNA-seq technologies, but different modalities as well. After demonstrating substantial improvement over existing methods for data integration, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq datasets to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets, and project single cell protein measurements onto a human bone marrow atlas to annotate and characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we demonstrate how anchoring can harmonize in-situ gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing for the transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns, and the identification of spatial relationships between mapped cell types in the visual cortex. Our work presents a strategy for comprehensive integration of single cell data, including the assembly of harmonized references, and the transfer of information across datasets.Availability: Installation instructions, documentation, and tutorials are available at: https://www.satijalab.org/seurat	1059	2.8993839835728954	9	96	86	0.08120868744098206	165.05
10.1101/460246	FALSE	TRUE	Wiring together large single-cell RNA-seq sample collections	2018-11-02	Single-cell RNA-seq methods are being increasingly applied in complex study designs, which involve measurements of many samples, commonly spanning multiple individuals, conditions, or tissue compartments. Joint analysis of such extensive, and often heterogeneous, sample collections requires a way of identifying and tracking recurrent cell subpopulations across the entire collection. Here we describe a flexible approach, called Conos (Clustering On Network Of Samples), that relies on multiple plausible inter-sample mappings to construct a global graph connecting all measured cells. The graph can then be used to propagate information between samples and to identify cell communities that show consistent grouping across broad subsets of the collected samples. Conos results enable investigators to balance between resolution and breadth of the detected subpopulations. In this way, it is possible to focus on the fine-grained clusters appearing within more similar subsets of samples, or analyze coarser clusters spanning broader sets of samples in the collection. Such multi-resolution joint clustering provides an important basis for downstream analysis and interpretation of sizeable multi-sample single-cell studies and atlas-scale collections.	1059	2.8993839835728954	7	16	13	0.012275731822474031	37.2

Comprehensive benchmarking tests on 17 public scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that SHARP outperforms existing methods in terms of speed and accuracy. Particularly, for large-size datasets (&gt;40,000 cells), SHARP’s running speed far excels other competitors while maintaining high clustering accuracy and robustness. To the best of our knowledge, SHARP is the only R-based tool that is scalable to clustering scRNA-seq data with 10 million cells.	1057	2.8939082819986313	3	39	2	0.001892147587511826	10.95
10.1101/461954	FALSE	TRUE	Fast, sensitive, and accurate integration of single cell data with Harmony	2018-11-04	The rapidly emerging diversity of single cell RNAseq datasets allows us to characterize the transcriptional behavior of cell types across a wide variety of biological and clinical conditions. With this comprehensive breadth comes a major analytical challenge. The same cell type across tissues, from different donors, or in different disease states, may appear to express different genes. A joint analysis of multiple datasets requires the integration of cells across diverse conditions. This is particularly challenging when datasets are assayed with different technologies in which real biological differences are interspersed with technical differences. We present Harmony, an algorithm that projects cells into a shared embedding in which cells group by cell type rather than dataset-specific conditions. Unlike available single-cell integration methods, Harmony can simultaneously account for multiple experimental and biological factors. We develop objective metrics to evaluate the quality of data integration. In four separate analyses, we demonstrate the superior performance of Harmony to four single-cell-specific integration algorithms. Moreover, we show that Harmony requires dramatically fewer computational resources. It is the only available algorithm that makes the integration of ∼ 106 cells feasible on a personal computer. We demonstrate that Harmony identifies both broad populations and fine-grained subpopulations of PBMCs from datasets with large experimental differences. In a meta-analysis of 14,746 cells from 5 studies of human pancreatic islet cells, Harmony accounts for variation among technologies and donors to successfully align several rare subpopulations. In the resulting integrated embedding, we identify a previously unidentified population of potentially dysfunctional alpha islet cells, enriched for genes active in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress response. The abundance of these alpha cells correlates across donors with the proportion of dysfunctional beta cells also enriched in ER stress response genes. Harmony is a fast and flexible general purpose integration algorithm that enables the identification of shared fine-grained subpopulations across a variety of experimental and biological conditions.	1057	2.8939082819986313	9	38	58	0.05487228003784295	68.83

State-of-the-art pipelines perform differential analysis after clustering on the same dataset.

It also raises many challenges due to the destructive measurements inherent to the technology. In this work we propose a new method named GRISLI for de novo GRN inference from scRNA-seq data. GRISLI infers a velocity vector field in the space of scRNA-seq data from profiles of individual data, and models the dynamics of cell trajectories with a linear ordinary differential equation to reconstruct the underlying GRN with a sparse regression procedure. We show on real data that GRISLI outperforms a recently proposed state-of-the-art method for GRN reconstruction from scRNA-seq data.	1054	2.8856947296372346	2	31	4	0.003795066413662239	12.83

However, resolving cell types within and, thus, comparison of scRNA-seq data across conditions is challenging due to technical factors such as sparsity, low number of cells and batch effect. To address these challenges we developed scID (Single Cell IDentification), which uses the framework of Fisher’s Linear Discriminant Analysis to identify transcriptionally related cell types between scRNA-seq datasets. We demonstrate the accuracy and performance of scID relative to existing methods on several published datasets. By increasing power to identify transcriptionally similar cell types across datasets, scID enhances investigator’s ability to extract biological insights from scRNA-seq data.	1047	2.86652977412731	3	26	9	0.008595988538681949	12.85

While such modeling has been proposed based on statistical, mechanistic and machine learning models in specific settings, no generalization of predictions to phenomena absent from training data (‘out-of-sample’) has yet been demonstrated. Here, we present scGen, a model combining variational autoencoders and latent space vector arithmetics for high-dimensional single-cell gene expression data. In benchmarks across a broad range of examples, we show that scGen accurately models dose and infection response of cells across cell types, studies and species. In particular, we demonstrate that scGen learns cell type and species specific response implying that it captures features that distinguish responding from non-responding genes and cells. With the upcoming availability of large-scale atlases of organs in healthy state, we envision scGen to become a tool for experimental design through in silico screening of perturbation response in the context of disease and drug treatment.	1032	2.8254620123203287	3	60	12	0.011627906976744186	38.18

We introduce a novel method, PopCorn (single cell sub-Populations Comparison), allowing for the identification of sub-populations of cells present within individual experiments while simultaneously performing sub-populations mapping across these experiments. PopCorn utilizes several novel algorithmic solutions enabling the execution of these tasks with unprecedented precision. As such, PopCorn provides a much-needed tool for comparative analysis of populations of single cells.	1027	2.811772758384668	3	0	0	0	4
10.1101/496810	FALSE	TRUE	Scalable probabilistic matrix factorization for single-cell RNA-seq analysis	2018-12-14	Motivation: The gene expression profile of a cell dictates its function in molecular processes, and can be used to probe its health status. This represents a step forward in the deep characterization of diseases such as cancer and may lead to breakthroughs in their treatment. The technology used to measure the gene expression of isolated cells, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), has emerged in the last decade as a key enabler of this progress. However, the use of existing methods for dimensionality reduction, clustering and differential expression is limited by the specificities of the data obtained from scRNA-seq experiments, where technical factors may confound analyses of the true biological signal and contribute to spurious results. To overcome this issue, a possible approach is designing probabilistic generative models of the data with hidden variables encoding different underlying processes. Results: We propose two novel probabilistic models for scRNA-seq data: modified probabilistic count matrix factorization (m-pCMF) and Bayesian zero-inflated negative binomial factorization (ZINBayes). These build upon previous models in the literature while leveraging scalable Bayesian inference via variational methods. We show that the proposed methods are competitive with the state-of-the-art models for robust dimensionality reduction in modern data sets, and improve upon the current best Bayesian model for small numbers of cells. The results show that building probabilistic models of latent variables which encode domain knowledge and using variational inference constitute a promising approach to analyse scRNA-seq data in a scalable way. Availability: m-pCMF and ZINBayes are publicly available as Python packages at https://github.com/pedrofale/, along with the code to reproduce all the results.

10.1101/504977	FALSE	TRUE	Imputation of single-cell gene expression with an autoencoder neural network	2018-12-29	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a rapidly evolving technology that enables measurement of gene expression levels at an unprecedented resolution. Despite the explosive growth in the number of cells that can be assayed by a single experiment, scRNA-seq still has several limitations, including high rates of dropouts, which result in a large number of genes having zero read count in the scRNA-seq data, and complicate downstream analyses.To overcome this problem, we treat zeros as missing values and develop nonparametric deep learning methods for imputation. Specifically, our LATE (Learning with AuToEncoder) method trains an autoencoder with random initial values of the parameters, whereas our TRANSLATE (TRANSfer learning with LATE) method further allows for the use of a reference gene expression data set to provide LATE with an initial set of parameter estimates.On both simulated and real data, LATE and TRANSLATE outperform existing scRNA-seq imputation methods, achieving lower mean squared error in most cases, recovering nonlinear gene-gene relationships, and better separating cell types. They are also highly scalable and can efficiently process over 1 million cells in just a few hours on a GPU.We demonstrate that our nonparametric approach to imputation based on autoencoders is powerful and highly efficient.	1002	2.7433264887063653	7	23	2	0.001996007984031936	30.88

A near-universal step in the analysis of single cell RNA-Seq data is to hypothesize the identity of each cell. Often, this is achieved by finding cells that express combinations of marker genes that had previously been implicated as being cell-type specific, an approach that is not quantitative and does not explicitly take advantage of other single cell RNA-Seq studies. Here, we describe our tool, SingleCellNet, which addresses these issues and enables the classification of query single cell RNA-Seq data in comparison to reference single cell RNA-Seq data. SingleCellNet compares favorably to other methods, and it is notably able to make sensitive and accurate classifications across platforms and species. We demonstrate how SingleCellNet can be used to classify previously undetermined cells, and how it can be used to assess the outcome of cell fate engineering experiments.	1000	2.737850787132101	2	0	10	0.01	29.634

It routinely uses machine learning methods, such as feature learning, clustering, and classification, to assist in uncovering novel information from scRNA-seq data. However, current methods are not well suited to deal with the substantial amounts of noise that is created by the experiments or the variation that occurs due to differences in the cells of the same type. Here, we develop a new hybrid approach, Deep Unsupervised Single-cell Clustering (DUSC), that integrates feature generation based on a deep learning architecture with a model-based clustering algorithm, to find a compact and informative representation of the single-cell transcriptomic data generating robust clusters. We also include a technique to estimate an efficient number of latent features in the deep learning model. Our method outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art feature learning and clustering methods, approaching the accuracy of supervised learning. The method is freely available to the community and will hopefully facilitate our understanding of the cellular atlas of living organisms as well as provide the means to improve patient diagnostics and treatment.	996	2.726899383983573	3	65	2	0.002008032128514056	14.63

While elucidation of cell state heterogeneity and its role in biology and pathobiology has been advanced by studying single cell level measurements, the underlying assumptions of current analytical methods limit the identification and exploration of cell clades. Unlike other methods, which produce a single uni-layer partition of cells ignoring echelons of cell states, we present TooManyCells, a software consisting of a suite of graph-based tools for efficient, global, and unbiased identification and visualization of cell clades while maintaining and presenting the relationship between cell states. TooManyCells provides a set of tools based on a matrix-free efficient divisive hierarchical spectral clustering algorithm wholly different from the prevalent Louvain-based methods. BirchBeer, the visualization component of TooManyCells, introduces a new approach for single cell analysis that is built on a concept intentionally orthogonal to the widely used dimensionality reduction methods. Together, this suite of tools provide a paradigm shift in the analysis and interpretation of single cell data by enabling simultaneous comparisons of cell states at context-and application-dependent scales. A byproduct of this shift is the immediate detection and visualization of rare populations that outperforms previous algorithms as demonstrated by applying these tools to existing single cell RNA-seq data sets from various mouse organs.	987	2.702258726899384	9	27	4	0.004052684903748734	21.384

For many applications, investigators wish to identify cell types with known marker genes. Typically, such cell type assignments are performed through unsupervised clustering followed by manual annotation based on these marker genes, or via ""mapping"" procedures to existing data. However, the manual interpretation required in the former case scales poorly to large datasets, which are also often prone to batch effects, while existing data for purified cell types must be available for the latter. Furthermore, unsupervised clustering can be error-prone, leading to under- and over- clustering of the cell types of interest. To overcome these issues we present CellAssign, a probabilistic model that leverages prior knowledge of cell type marker genes to annotate scRNA-seq data into pre-defined and de novo cell types. CellAssign automates the process of assigning cells in a highly scalable manner across large datasets while simultaneously controlling for batch and patient effects.

10.1101/522672	FALSE	TRUE	Dynamic pseudo-time warping of complex single-cell trajectories	2019-01-17	Single-cell RNA sequencing enables the construction of trajectories describing the dynamic changes in gene expression underlying biological processes such as cell differentiation and development. The comparison of single-cell trajectories under two distinct conditions can illuminate the differences and similarities between the two and can thus be a powerful tool. Recently developed methods for the comparison of trajectories rely on the concept of dynamic time warping (dtw), which was originally proposed for the comparison of two time series. Consequently, these methods are restricted to simple, linear trajectories. Here, we adopt and theoretically link arboreal matchings to dtw and propose an algorithm to compare complex trajectories that more realistically contain branching points that divert cells into different fates. We implement a suite of exact and heuristic algorithms suitable for the comparison of trajectories of different characteristics in our tool Trajan. Trajan automatically pairs similar biological processes between conditions and aligns them in a globally consistent manner. In an alignment of singlecell trajectories describing human muscle differentiation and myogenic reprogramming, Trajan identifies and aligns the core paths without prior information. From Trajan’s alignment, we are able to reproduce recently reported barriers to reprogramming. In a perturbation experiment, we demonstrate the benefits in terms of robustness and accuracy of our model which compares entire trajectories at once, as opposed to a pairwise application of dtw. Trajan is available at https://github.com/canzarlab/Trajan.	983	2.6913073237508556	9	25	1	0.001017293997965412	21.264
10.1101/523993	FALSE	TRUE	VPAC: Variational projection for accurate clustering of single-cell transcriptomic data	2019-01-18	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent years and enabled the quantitative characterization at a microscopic resolution. With the exponential growth of the number of cells profiled in individual scRNA-seq experiments, the demand for identifying putative cell types from the data has become a great challenge that appeals for novel computational methods. Although a variety of algorithms have recently been proposed for single-cell clustering, such limitations as low accuracy, inferior robustness, and inadequate stability greatly impede the scope of applications of these methods.We propose a novel model-based algorithm, named VPAC, for accurate clustering of single-cell transcriptomic data through variational projection, which assumes that single-cell samples follow a Gaussian mixture distribution in a latent space. Through comprehensive validation experiments, we demonstrate that VPAC can not only be applied to datasets of discrete counts and normalized continuous data, but also scale up well to various data dimensionality, different dataset size and different data sparsity. We further illustrate the ability of VPAC to detect genes with strong unique signatures of a specific cell type, which may shed light on the studies in system biology. We have released a user-friendly python package of VPAC in Github (https://github.com/ShengquanChen/VPAC). Users can directly import our VPAC class and conduct clustering without tedious installation of dependency packages.VPAC enables highly accurate clustering of single-cell transcriptomic data via a statistical model. We expect to see wide applications of our method to not only transcriptome studies for fully understanding the cell identity and functionality, but also the clustering of more general data.	982	2.6885694729637235	4	40	0	0	16.014
10.1101/526848	FALSE	TRUE	Characterizing and inferring quantitative cell cycle phase in single-cell RNA-seq data analysis	2019-02-03	Cellular heterogeneity in gene expression is driven by cellular processes such as cell cycle and cell-type identity, and cellular environment such as spatial location. The cell cycle, in particular, is thought to be a key driver of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression, even in otherwise homogeneous cell populations. Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) facilitate detailed characterization of gene expression heterogeneity, and can thus shed new light on the processes driving heterogeneity. Here, we combined fluorescence imaging with scRNA-seq to measure cell cycle phase and gene expression levels in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Using these data, we developed a novel approach to characterize cell cycle progression. While standard methods assign cells to discrete cell cycle stages, our method goes beyond this, and quantifies cell cycle progression on a continuum. We found that, on average, scRNA-seq data from only five genes predicted a cell’s position on the cell cycle continuum to within 14% of the entire cycle, and that using more genes did not improve this accuracy. Our data and predictor of cell cycle phase can directly help future studies to account for cell-cycle-related heterogeneity in iPSCs. Our results and methods also provide a foundation for future work to characterize the effects of the cell cycle on expression heterogeneity in other cell types.	966	2.64476386036961	8	49	3	0.003105590062111801	34.2

We present an unsupervised deep embedding algorithm for single-cell clustering (DESC) that iteratively learns cluster-specific gene expression signatures and cluster assignment. DESC significantly improves clustering accuracy across various datasets and is capable of removing complex batch effects while maintaining true biological variations.	975	2.6694045174537986	8	22	5	0.005128205128205128	10.93
10.1101/532093	FALSE	TRUE	Automated identification of Cell Types in Single Cell RNA Sequencing	2019-01-28	Cell type identification is one of the major goals in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Current methods for assigning cell types typically involve the use of unsupervised clustering, the identification of signature genes in each cluster, followed by a manual lookup of these genes in the literature and databases to assign cell types. However, there are several limitations associated with these approaches, such as unwanted sources of variation that influence clustering and a lack of canonical markers for certain cell types. Here, we present ACTINN (Automated Cell Type Identification using Neural Networks), which employs a neural network with 3 hidden layers, trains on datasets with predefined cell types, and predicts cell types for other datasets based on the trained parameters. We trained the neural network on a mouse cell type atlas (Tabula Muris Atlas) and a human immune cell dataset, and used it to predict cell types for mouse leukocytes, human PBMCs and human T cell sub types. The results showed that our neural network is fast and accurate, and should therefore be a useful tool to complement existing scRNA-seq pipelines.Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides high resolution profiling of the transcriptomes of individual cells, which inevitably results in high volumes of data that require complex data processing pipelines. Usually, one of the first steps in the analysis of scRNA-seq is to assign individual cells to known cell types. To accomplish this, traditional methods first group the cells into different clusters, then find marker genes, and finally use these to manually assign cell types for each cluster. Thus these methods require prior knowledge of cell type canonical markers, and some level of subjectivity to make the cell type assignments. As a result, the process is often laborious and requires domain specific expertise, which is a barrier for inexperienced users. By contrast, our neural network ACTINN automatically learns the features for each predefined cell type and uses these features to predict cell types for individual cells. This approach is computationally efficient and requires no domain expertise of the tissues being studied. We believe ACTINN allows users to rapidly identify cell types in their datasets, thus rendering the analysis of their scRNA-seq datasets more efficient.	972	2.6611909650924024	2	10	5	0.0051440329218107	23.6
10.1101/532192	FALSE	TRUE	Block HSIC Lasso: model-free biomarker detection for ultra-high dimensional data	2019-01-28	Finding nonlinear relationships between biomolecules and a biological outcome is computationally expensive and statistically challenging. Existing methods have crucial drawbacks, among others lack of parsimony, non-convexity, and computational overhead. Here we present the block HSIC Lasso, a nonlinear feature selector that does not present the previous drawbacks.We compare the block HSIC Lasso to other state-of-the-art feature selection techniques in synthetic data and real data, including experiments over three common types of genomic data: gene-expression microarrays, single-cell RNA-seq, and GWAS. In all the cases, we observe that features selected by block HSIC Lasso retain more information about the underlying biology than features of other techniques. As a proof of concept, we applied the block HSIC Lasso to a single-cell RNA-seq experiment on mouse hippocampus. We discovered that many genes linked in the past to brain development and function are involved in the biological differences between the types of neurons.Block HSIC Lasso is implemented in the Python 2/3 package pyHSICLasso, available in Github (https://github.com/riken-aip/pyHSICLasso) and PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/pyHSICLasso).myamada@i.kyoto-u.ac.jpSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	972	2.6611909650924024	4	31	0	0	11.4

                    resolution"	2019-01-28	Current methods for comparing scRNA-seq datasets collected in multiple conditions focus on discrete regions of the transcriptional state space, such as clusters of cells. Here, we quantify the effects of perturbations at the single-cell level using a continuous measure of the effect of a perturbation across the transcriptomic space. We describe this space as a manifold and develop a relative likelihood estimate of observing each cell in each of the experimental conditions using graph signal processing. This likelihood estimate can be used to identify cell populations specifically affected by a perturbation. We also develop vertex frequency clustering to extract populations of affected cells at the level of granularity that matches the perturbation response. The accuracy of our algorithm to identify clusters of cells that are enriched or depleted in each condition is on average 57% higher than the next best-performing algorithm tested. Gene signatures derived from these clusters are more accurate compared to six alternative algorithms in ground-truth comparisons.	972	2.6611909650924024	10	78	10	0.0102880658436214	23.75
10.1101/532895	FALSE	TRUE	Probabilistic Harmonization and Annotation of Single-cell Transcriptomics Data with Deep Generative Models	2019-01-29	As single-cell transcriptomics becomes a mainstream technology, the natural next step is to integrate the accumulating data in order to achieve a common ontology of cell types and states. However, owing to various nuisance factors of variation, it is not straightforward how to compare gene expression levels across data sets and how to automatically assign cell type labels in a new data set based on existing annotations. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that our previously developed method, scVI, provides an effective and fully probabilistic approach for joint representation and analysis of cohorts of single-cell RNA-seq data sets, while accounting for uncertainty caused by biological and measurement noise. We also introduce single-cell ANnotation using Variational Inference (scANVI), a semi-supervised variant of scVI designed to leverage any available cell state annotations — for instance when only one data set in a cohort is annotated, or when only a few cells in a single data set can be labeled using marker genes. We demonstrate that scVI and scANVI compare favorably to the existing methods for data integration and cell state annotation in terms of accuracy, scalability, and adaptability to challenging settings such as a hierarchical structure of cell state labels. We further show that different from existing methods, scVI and scANVI represent the integrated datasets with a single generative model that can be directly used for any probabilistic decision making task, using differential expression as our case study. scVI and scANVI are available as open source software and can be readily used to facilitate cell state annotation and help ensure consistency and reproducibility across studies.	971	2.6584531143052703	6	99	16	0.016477857878475798	12.2
10.1101/533372	FALSE	TRUE	Flexible Experimental Designs for Valid Single-cell RNA-sequencing Experiments Allowing Batch Effects Correction	2019-01-29	Despite their widespread applications, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments are still plagued by batch effects and dropout events. Although the completely randomized experimental design has frequently been advocated to control for batch effects, it is rarely implemented in real applications due to time and budget constraints. Here, we mathematically prove that under two more flexible and realistic experimental designs—the “reference panel” and the “chain-type” designs—true biological variability can also be separated from batch effects. We develop Batch effects correction with Unknown Subtypes for scRNA-seq data (BUSseq), which is an interpretable Bayesian hierarchical model that closely follows the data-generating mechanism of scRNA-seq experiments. BUSseq can simultaneously correct batch effects, cluster cell types, impute missing data caused by dropout events, and detect differentially expressed genes without requiring a preliminary normalization step. We demonstrate that BUSseq outperforms existing methods with simulated and real data.	971	2.6584531143052703	3	39	1	0.0010298661174047373	6.6
10.1101/534834	FALSE	TRUE	Network Inference with Granger Causality Ensembles on Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data	2019-01-30	Advances in single-cell transcriptomics enable measuring the gene expression of individual cells, allowing cells to be ordered by their state in a dynamic biological process. Many algorithms assign ‘pseudotimes’ to each cell, representing the progress along the biological process. Ordering the expression data according to such pseudotimes can be valuable for understanding the underlying regulator-gene interactions in a biological process, such as differentiation. However, the distribution of cells sampled along a transitional process, and hence that of the pseudotimes assigned to them, is not uniform. This prevents using many standard mathematical methods for analyzing the ordered gene expression states. We present Single-cell Inference of Networks using Granger Ensembles (SINGE), an algorithm for gene regulatory network inference from single-cell gene expression data. Given ordered single-cell data, SINGE uses kernel-based Granger Causality regression, which smooths the irregular pseudotimes and missing expression values. It then aggregates the predictions from an ensemble of regression analyses with a modified Borda count to compile a ranked list of candidate interactions between transcriptional regulators and their target genes. In two mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation case studies, SINGE outperforms other contemporary algorithms for gene network reconstruction. However, a more detailed examination reveals caveats about transcriptional network reconstruction with single-cell RNA-seq data. Network inference methods, including SINGE, may have near random performance for predicting the targets of many individual regulators even if the overall performance is good. In addition, including uninformative pseudotime values can hurt the performance of network reconstruction methods. A MATLAB implementation of SINGE is available at https://github.com/gitter-lab/SINGE.	970	2.6557152635181382	4	137	12	0.012371134020618556	42.83

Here, we describe how to enhance and accelerate single-cell data analysis by summarizing the transcriptomic heterogeneity within a data set using a small subset of cells, which we refer to as a geometric sketch. Our sketches provide more comprehensive visualization of transcriptional diversity, capture rare cell types with high sensitivity, and accurately reveal biological cell types via clustering. Our sketch of umbilical cord blood cells uncovers a rare subpopulation of inflammatory macrophages, which we experimentally validatedin vitro. The construction of our sketches is extremely fast, which enabled us to accelerate other crucial resource-intensive tasks such as scRNA-seq data integration. We anticipate that our algorithm will become an increasingly essential step when sharing and analyzing the rapidly-growing volume of scRNA-seq data and help enable the democratization of single-cell omics.	969	2.652977412731006	5	64	3	0.0030959752321981426	73.434

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods, particularly “full-length” ones, provide read coverage of many individual cells and have the potential to reveal cellular heterogeneity in RNA transcription and processing. However, visualization tools suited to highlighting cell-to-cell heterogeneity in read coverage are still lacking.Here, we have developed Millefy, a tool for visualizing read coverage of scRNA-seq data in genomic contexts. Millefy is designed to show read coverage of all individual cells at once in genomic contexts and to highlight cell-to-cell heterogeneity in read coverage. By visualizing read coverage of all cells as a heat map and dynamically reordering cells based on diffusion maps, Millefy facilitates discovery of “local” region-specific, cell-to-cell heterogeneity in read coverage, including variability of transcribed regions.Millefy simplifies the examination of cellular heterogeneity in RNA transcription and processing events using scRNA-seq data.

Here we describe Garnett, an algorithm and accompanying software for rapidly annotating cell types in scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets, based on an interpretable, hierarchical markup language of cell type-specific genes.

10.1101/539833	FALSE	TRUE	Polled Digital Cell Sorter (p-DCS): Automatic identification of hematological cell types from single cell RNA-sequencing clusters	2019-02-04	Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) brings unprecedented opportunities for mapping the heterogeneity of complex cellular environments such as bone marrow, and provides insight into many cellular processes. Single cell RNA-seq, however, has a far larger fraction of missing data reported as zeros (dropouts) than traditional bulk RNA-seq. This makes difficult not only the clustering of cells, but also the assignment of the resulting clusters into predefined cell types based on known molecular signatures, such as the expression of characteristic cell surface markers.We present a computational tool for processing single cell RNA-seq data that uses a voting algorithm to identify cells based on approval votes received by known molecular markers. Using a stochastic procedure that accounts for biases due to dropout errors and imbalances in the number of known molecular signatures for different cell types, the method computes the statistical significance of the final approval score and automatically assigns a cell type to clusters without an expert curator. We demonstrate the utility of the tool in the analysis of eight samples of bone marrow from the Human Cell Atlas. The tool provides a systematic identification of cell types in bone marrow based on a recently-published manually-curated cell marker database [1], and incorporates a suite of visualization tools that can be overlaid on a t-SNE representation. The software is freely available as a python package at https://github.com/sdomanskyi/DigitalCellSorterThis methodology assures that extensive marker to cell type matching information is taken into account in a systematic way when assigning cell clusters to cell types. Moreover, the method allows for a high throughput processing of multiple scRNA-seq datasets, since it does not involve an expert curator, and it can be applied recursively to obtain cell sub-types. The software is designed to allow the user to substitute the marker to cell type matching information and apply the methodology to different cellular environments.	965	2.642026009582478	6	27	4	0.004145077720207254	1.75
10.1101/543199	FALSE	TRUE	Single-cell profiling of tumor-reactive CD4+ T-cells reveals unexpected transcriptomic diversity	2019-02-08	Most current tumor immunotherapy strategies leverage cytotoxic CD8+T cells. Despite evidence for clinical potential of CD4+tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), their functional diversity has limited our ability to harness their activity. To address this issue, we have used single-cell mRNA sequencing to analyze the response of CD4+T cells specific for a defined recombinant tumor antigen, both in the tumor microenvironment and draining lymph nodes (dLN). Designing new computational approaches to characterize subpopulations, we identify TIL transcriptomic patterns strikingly distinct from those elicited by responses to infection, and dominated by diversity among T-bet-expressing T helper type 1 (Th1)-like cells. In contrast, the dLN response includes follicular helper (Tfh)-like cells but lacks Th1 cells. We identify a type I interferon-driven signature in Th1-like TILs, and show that it is found in human liver cancer and melanoma, in which it is negatively associated with response to checkpoint therapy. Our study unveils unsuspected differences between tumor and virus CD4+T cell responses, and provides a proof-of-concept methodology to characterize tumor specific CD4+T cell effector programs. Targeting these programs should help improve immunotherapy strategies.Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals novel and highly diverse transcriptomic patterns characteristic of CD4+T cell responses to tumors.	961	2.631074606433949	10	77	0	0	20.05

Integrating such scRNA-seq data from different developmental stages and from different laboratories is critical to comprehensively define and understand the molecular dynamics and systematically reconstruct the lineage trajectories. Here, we describe a novel algorithm to integrate heterogenous temporal scRNA-seq datasets and to preserve the global developmental trajectories. We applied this algorithm and approach to integrate 3,387 single cells from seven heterogenous temporal scRNA-seq datasets, and reconstructed the cell atlas of early mouse cardiovascular development from E6.5 to E9.5. Using this integrated atlas, we identified an Etv2 downstream target, Ebf1, as an important transcription factor for mouse endothelial development.	962	2.6338124572210813	11	38	1	0.0010395010395010396	8.434

Transcript diversity caused by phenomena such as aberrant splicing events have been revealed, and differential expression of previously unannotated transcripts might be overlooked by annotation-based analyses.Accordingly, we have developed an approach to discover overlooked differentially expressed (DE) gene regions that complements annotation-based methods. We applied our algorithm to two datasets and discovered several intriguing DE transcripts, including a transcript related to the modulation of neural stem/progenitor cell differentiation.	961	2.631074606433949	9	46	0	0	27.15
10.1101/544163	FALSE	TRUE	scGEApp: a Matlab app for feature selection on single-cell RNA sequencing data	2019-02-08	The recent development of single-cell technologies, especially single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), provides an unprecedented level of resolution to the cell type heterogeneity. It also enables the study of gene expression variability across individual cells within a homogenous cell population. Feature selection algorithms have been used to select biologically meaningful genes while controlling for sampling noise. An easy-to-use application for feature selection on scRNA-seq data requires integration of functions for data filtering, normalization, visualization, and enrichment analyses. Graphic user interfaces (GUIs) are desired for such an application.We used native Matlab and App Designer to develop scGEApp for feature selection on singlecell gene expression data. We specifically designed a new feature selection algorithm based on the 3D spline fitting of expression mean (μ), coefficient of variance (CV), and dropout rate (rdrop), making scGEApp a unique tool for feature selection on scRNA-seq data. Our method can be applied to single-sample or two-sample scRNA-seq data, identify feature genes, e.g., those with unexpectedly high CV for given μ and rdrop of those genes, or genes with the most feature changes. Users can operate scGEApp through GUIs to use the full spectrum of functions including normalization, batch effect correction, imputation, visualization, feature selection, and downstream analyses with GSEA and GOrilla.https://github.com/jamesjcai/scGEAppContact:jcai@tamu.eduSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	961	2.631074606433949	1	5	2	0.002081165452653486	9.58

Due to technical limitations, scRNA-seq data often contain zero counts for many transcripts in individual cells. These zero counts, or dropout events, complicate the analysis of scRNA-seq data using standard analysis methods developed for bulk RNA-seq data. Current scRNA-seq analysis methods typically overcome dropout by combining information across cells, leveraging the observation that cells generally occupy a small number of RNA expression states.We introduce netNMF-sc, an algorithm for scRNA-seq analysis that leverages information across both cells and genes. netNMF-sc combines network-regularized non-negative matrix factorization with a procedure for handling zero inflation in transcript count matrices. The matrix factorization results in a low-dimensional representation of the transcript count matrix, which imputes gene abundance for both zero and non-zero entries and can be used to cluster cells. The network regularization leverages prior knowledge of gene-gene interactions, encouraging pairs of genes with known interactions to be close in the low-dimensional representation. We show that netNMF-sc outperforms existing methods on simulated and real scRNA-seq data, with increasing advantage at higher dropout rates (e.g. above 60%). Furthermore, we show that the results from netNMF-sc – including estimation of gene-gene covariance – are robust to choice of network, with more representative networks leading to greater performance gains.netNMF-sc is available at github.com/raphael-group/netNMF-sc.braphael@princeton.edu	961	2.631074606433949	4	39	3	0.003121748178980229	24.88

This task is, however, challenging due to the relatively large dropout rate and noisy nature of single-cell RNA-Seq data. Here we present a novel statistical inference framework called SCIRA (Single Cell Inference of Regulatory Activity), which leverages the power of large-scale bulk RNA-Seq datasets to infer high-quality tissue-specific regulatory networks, from which regulatory activity estimates in single cells can be subsequently obtained. We show that SCIRA can correctly infer regulatory activity of transcription factors affected by high technical dropouts. In particular, SCIRA can improve sensitivity by as much as 70% compared to differential expression analysis and current state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, SCIRA can reveal novel regulators of cell-fate in tissue-development, even for cell-types that only make up 5% of the tissue, and can identify key novel tumor suppressor genes in cancer at single cell resolution. In summary, SCIRA will be an invaluable tool for single-cell studies aiming to accurately map activity patterns of key transcription factors during development, and how these are altered in disease.	947	2.5927446954141	2	63	2	0.0021119324181626186	10.58

CHETAH (CHaracterization of cEll Types Aided by Hierarchical clustering) is an accurate cell type identification algorithm that is rapid and selective, including the possibility of intermediate or unassigned categories. Evidence for assignment is based on a classification tree of previously available scRNA-seq reference data and includes a confidence score based on the variance in gene expression per cell type. For cell types represented in the reference data, CHETAH’s accuracy is as good as existing methods. Its specificity is superior when cells of an unknown type are encountered, such as malignant cells in tumor samples which it pinpoints as intermediate or unassigned. Although designed for tumor samples in particular, the use of unassigned and intermediate types is also valuable in other exploratory studies. This is exemplified in pancreas datasets where CHETAH highlights cell populations not well represented in the reference dataset, including cells with profiles that lie on a continuum between that of acinar and ductal cell types. Having the possibility of unassigned and intermediate cell types is pivotal for preventing misclassification and can yield important biological information for previously unexplored tissues.	947	2.5927446954141	5	53	8	0.008447729672650475	15.83
10.1101/559872	FALSE	TRUE	SCINA: Semi-Supervised Analysis of Single Cells in silico	2019-02-25	Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) have allowed for comprehensive analyses of single cell data. However, current analyses of scRNA-Seq data usually start from unsupervised clustering or visualization. These methods ignore the prior knowledge of transcriptomes and of the probable structures of the data. Moreover, cell identification heavily relies on subjective and inaccurate human inspection afterwards. We reversed this paradigm and developed SCINA, a semi-supervised model, for analyses of scRNA-Seq and flow cytometry/CyTOF data, and other data of similar format, by automatically exploiting previously established gene signatures using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We applied SCINA on a wide range of datasets, and showed its accuracy, stableness and efficiency exceeded most popular unsupervised approaches. Notably, SCINA discovered an intermediate stage of oligodendrocyte from mouse brain scRNA-Seq data. SCINA also detected immune cell population shifting in Stk4 knock-out mouse cytometry data. Finally, SCINA identified a new kidney tumor clade with similarity to FH-deficient tumors from bulk tumor data. Overall, SCINA provides both methodological advances and biological insights from perspectives different from traditional analytical methods.	944	2.5845311430527036	16	39	4	0.00423728813559322	7.83
10.1101/561084	FALSE	TRUE	Nonparametric expression analysis using inferential replicate counts	2019-02-25	A primary challenge in the analysis of RNA-seq data is to identify differentially expressed genes or transcripts while controlling for technical biases present in the observations. Ideally, a statistical testing procedure should incorporate information about the inherent uncertainty of the abundance estimates, whether at the gene or transcript level, that arise from quantification of abundance. Most popular methods for RNA-seq differential expression analysis fit a parametric model to the counts or scaled counts for each gene or transcript, and a subset of methods can incorporate information about the uncertainty of the counts. Previous work has shown that nonparametric models for RNA-seq differential expression may in some cases have better control of the false discovery rate, and adapt well to new data types without requiring reformulation of a parametric model. Existing nonparametric models do not take into account the inferential uncertainty of the observations, leading to an inflated false discovery rate, in particular at the transcript level. Here we propose a nonparametric model for differential expression analysis using inferential replicate counts, extending the existing SAMseq method to account for inferential uncertainty, batch effects, and sample pairing. We compare our method, “SAMseq With Inferential Samples Helps”, or Swish, with popular differential expression analysis methods. Swish has improved control of the false discovery rate, in particular for transcripts with high inferential uncertainty. We apply Swish to a singlecell RNA-seq dataset, assessing sensitivity to recover DE genes between sub-populations of cells, and compare its performance to the Wilcoxon rank sum test.	944	2.5845311430527036	5	55	0	0	4.35
10.1101/564021	FALSE	TRUE	scds: Computational Annotation of Doublets in Single Cell RNA Sequencing Data	2019-02-28	Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable the study of transcriptional heterogeneity at the resolution of individual cells and have an increasing impact on biomedical research. Specifically, high-throughput approaches that employ micro-fluidics in combination with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) are capable of assaying many thousands of cells per experiment and are rapidly becoming commonplace. However, it is known that these methods sometimes wrongly consider two or more cells as single cells, and that a number of so-called doublets is present in the output of such experiments. Treating doublets as single cells in downstream analyses can severely bias a study’s conclusions, and therefore computational strategies for the identification of doublets are needed. Here we present single cell doublet scoring (scds), a software tool for the in silico identification of doublets in scRNA-seq data.With scds, we propose two new and complementary approaches for doublet identification: Co-expression based doublet scoring (cxds) and binary classification based doublet scoring (bcds). The co-expression based approach, cxds, utilizes binarized (absence/presence) gene expression data and employs a binomial model for the co-expression of pairs of genes and yields interpretable doublet annotations. bcds, on the other hand, uses a binary classification approach to discriminate artificial doublets from the original data. We apply our methods and existing doublet identification approaches to four data sets with experimental doublet annotations and find that our methods perform at least as well as the state of the art, but at comparably little computational cost. We also find appreciable differences between methods and across data sets, that no approach dominates all others, and we believe there is room for improvement in computational doublet identification as more data with experimental annotations becomes available. In the meanwhile, scds presents a scalable, competitive approach that allows for doublet annotations in thousands of cells in a matter of seconds.scds is implemented as an R package and freely available at https://github.com/kostkalab/scds.kostka@pitt.edu	941	2.5763175906913074	2	44	4	0.004250797024442083	0.5
10.1101/565549	FALSE	TRUE	A lineage-resolved molecular atlas of C. elegans embryogenesis at single cell resolution	2019-03-01	C. elegans is an animal with few cells, but a striking diversity of cell types. Here, we characterize the molecular basis for their specification by profiling the transcriptomes of 84,625 single embryonic cells. We identify 284 terminal and pre-terminal cell types, mapping most single cell transcriptomes to their exact position in C. elegans’ invariant lineage. We use these annotations to perform the first quantitative analysis of the relationship between lineage and the transcriptome for a whole organism. We find that a strong lineage-transcriptome correlation in the early embryo breaks down in the final two cell divisions as cells adopt their terminal fates and that most distinct lineages that produce the same anatomical cell type converge to a homogenous transcriptomic state. Users can explore our data with a graphical application “VisCello”.	940	2.5735797399041753	12	52	15	0.015957446808510637	94.684
10.1101/566182	FALSE	TRUE	Uncovering hypergraphs of cell-cell interaction from single cell RNA-sequencing data	2019-03-04	Complex biological systems can be described as a multitude of cell-cell interactions (CCIs). Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies have enabled the detection of CCIs and related ligand-receptor (L-R) gene expression simultaneously. However, previous data analysis methods have focused on only one-to-one CCIs between two cell types. To also detect many-to-many CCIs, we proposescTensor, a novel method for extracting representative triadic relationships (hypergraphs), which include (i) ligand-expression, (ii) receptor-expression, and (iii) L-R pairs. When applied to simulated and empirical datasets,scTensorwas able to detect some hypergraphs including paracrine/autocrine CCI patterns, which cannot be detected by previous methods.	937	2.565366187542779	3	88	15	0.016008537886873	36.05
10.1101/567115	FALSE	TRUE	GPseudoClust: deconvolution of shared pseudo-profiles at single-cell resolution	2019-03-05	Many methods have been developed to cluster genes on the basis of their changes in mRNA expression over time, using bulk RNA-seq or microarray data. However, single-cell data may present a particular challenge for these algorithms, since the temporal ordering of cells is not directly observed. One way to address this is to first use pseudotime methods to order the cells, and then apply clustering techniques for time course data. However, pseudotime estimates are subject to high levels of uncertainty, and failing to account for this uncertainty is liable to lead to erroneous and/or over-confident gene clusters.The proposed method, GPseudoClust, is a novel approach that jointly infers pseudotem-poral ordering and gene clusters, and quantifies the uncertainty in both. GPseudoClust combines a recent method for pseudotime inference with nonparametric Bayesian clustering methods, efficient MCMC sampling, and novel subsampling strategies which aid computation. We consider a broad array of simulated and experimental datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of GPseudoClust in a range of settings.An implementation is available on GitHub: https://github.com/magStra/nonparametricSummaryPSM and https://github.com/magStra/GPseudoClust.ms58@sanger.ac.ukSupplementary materials are available.	936	2.5626283367556466	4	56	0	0	19.08
10.1101/570507	FALSE	TRUE	MultiCapsNet: a interpretable deep learning classifier integrate data from multiple sources	2019-03-07	Recent advances in experimental biology have generated huge amount of data. Due to differences present in detection targets and detection mechanisms, the produced data comes with different formats and lengths. There is an urgent call for computational methods to integrate these diverse data. Deep learning model is an ideal tool to cope with complex datasets, but its inherent ‘black box’ nature needs more interpretability. Here, we present MultiCapsNet, a deep learning model built on CapsNet and scCapsNet. The MultiCapsNet model possesses the merits of both easier data integration and higher model interpretability. In the first example, we use the labeled variant call dataset, which is originally used to test the models for automating somatic variant refinement. We divide the 71 features listed in the dataset into eight groups according to data source and data property. Then, the data from those eight groups with different formats and lengths are integrated by our MultiCapsNet to predict the labels associated with each variant call. The performance of our MultiCapsNet matches the previous deep learning model well, given much less parameters than those needed by the previous model. After training, the MultiCapsNet model provides importance scores for each data source directly, while the previous deep learning model needs an extra importance determination step to do so. Despite that our MultiCapsNet model is substantially different from the previous deep learning model and the source importance measuring methods are also different, the importance score correlation between these two models is very high. In the second example, the prior knowledge, including information for protein-protein interactions and protein-DNA interactions, is used to determine the structure of MultiCapsNet model. The single cell RNA sequence data are decoupled into multiple parts according to the structure of MultiCapsNet model that has been integrated with prior knowledge, with each part represents genes influenced by a transcription factor or involved in a protein-protein interaction network and then could be viewed as a data source. The MultiCapsNet model could classify cells with high accuracy as well as reveal the contribution of each data source for cell type recognition. The high ranked contributors are often relevant to the contributed cell type.	934	2.5571526351813825	4	31	3	0.0032119914346895075	11.43
10.1101/570614	FALSE	TRUE	Genotype-free demultiplexing of pooled single-cell RNA-seq	2019-03-07	A variety of experimental and computational methods have been developed to demultiplex samples from pooled individuals in a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) experiment which either require adding information (such as hashtag barcodes) or measuring information (such as genotypes) prior to pooling. We introduce scSplit which utilises genetic differences inferred from scRNA-Seq data alone to demultiplex pooled samples. scSplit also extracts a minimal set of high confidence presence/absence genotypes in each cluster which can be used to map clusters to original samples. Using a range of simulated, merged individual-sample as well as pooled multi-individual scRNA-Seq datasets, we show that scSplit is highly accurate and concordant with demuxlet predictions. Furthermore, scSplit predictions are highly consistent with the known truth in cell-hashing dataset. We also show that multiplexed-scRNA-Seq can be used to reduce batch effects caused by technical biases. scSplit is ideally suited to samples for which external genome-wide genotype data cannot be obtained (for example non-model organisms), or for which it is impossible to obtain unmixed samples directly, such as mixtures of genetically distinct tumour cells, or mixed infections. scSplit is available at: https://github.com/jon-xu/scSplit	934	2.5571526351813825	15	15	5	0.0053533190578158455	25.03

Recent scRNA-Seq datasets have incorporated unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Using negative controls, we show UMI counts follow multinomial sampling with no zero-inflation. Current normalization pro-cedures such as log of counts per million and feature selection by highly variable genes produce false variability in dimension reduction. We pro-pose simple multinomial methods, including generalized principal component analysis (GLM-PCA) for non-normal distributions, and feature selection using deviance. These methods outperform current practice in a downstream clustering assessment using ground-truth datasets.	930	2.546201232032854	4	50	30	0.03225806451612903	203.53
10.1101/576827	FALSE	TRUE	Normalization and variance stabilization of single-cell RNA-seq data using regularized negative binomial regression	2019-03-14	Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data exhibits significant cell-to-cell variation due to technical factors, including the number of molecules detected in each cell, which can confound biological heterogeneity with technical effects. To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from ’regularized negative binomial regression’, where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation, and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression. Our approach can be applied to any UMI-based scRNA-seq dataset and is freely available as part of the R packagesctransform, with a direct interface to our single-cell toolkitSeurat.	927	2.537987679671458	2	34	66	0.07119741100323625	117.38
10.1101/586859	FALSE	TRUE	Single-cell interactomes of the human brain reveal cell-type specific convergence of brain disorders	2019-03-24	The reference human interactome has been instrumental in the systems-level study of the molecular inner workings of the cell, providing a framework to analyze the network context of disease associated gene perturbations. However, reference organismal interactomes do not capture the tissue- and cell type-specific context in which proteins and modules preferentially act. Emerging single-cell profiling technologies, which survey the transcriptional cell-state distribution of complex tissues, could be used to infer the single-cell context of gene interactions. Here we introduce SCINET (Single-Cell Imputation and NETwork construction), a computational framework that reconstructs an ensemble of cell type-specific interactomes by integrating a global, context-independent reference interactome with a single-cell gene expression profile. SCINET addresses technical challenges of single-cell data by robustly imputing, transforming, and normalizing the initially noisy and sparse expression data. Subsequently, cell-level gene interaction probabilities and group-level gene interaction strengths are computed, resulting in cell type specific interactomes. We use SCINET to analyze the human cortex, reconstructing interactomes for the major cell types of the adult human brain. We identify network neighborhoods composed of topologically-specific genes that are central for cell-type influence but not for global interactome connectivity. We use the reconstructed interactomes to analyze the specificity and modularity of perturbations associated with neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric, and neoplastic brain disorders; finding high variability across diseases, yet overall consistency in patterns of cell-type convergence for diseases of the same group. We infer for each disorder group disease gene networks with preferential cell-type specific activity that can aid the design and interpretation of cell-type resolution experiments. Finally, focusing on the pleiotropy of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, we show how cell type specific interactomes enable the identification of disease genes with preferential influence on neuronal, glial, or glial-neuronal cells. The SCINET framework is applicable to any organism, cell-type/tissue, and reference network; it is freely available athttps://github.com/shmohammadi86/SCINET.	917	2.510609171800137	3	49	1	0.0010905125408942203	42.25

10.1101/598748	FALSE	TRUE	Vireo: Bayesian demultiplexing of pooled single-cell RNA-seq data without genotype reference	2019-04-04	The joint analysis of multiple samples using single-cell RNA-seq is a promising experimental design, offering both increased throughput while allowing to account for batch variation. To achieve multi-sample designs, genetic variants that segregate between the samples in the pool have been proposed as natural barcodes for cell demultiplexing. Existing demultiplexing strategies rely on access to complete genotype data from the pooled samples, which greatly limits the applicability of such methods, in particular when genetic variation is not the primary object of study. To address this, we here present Vireo, a computationally efficient Bayesian model to demultiplex single-cell data from pooled experimental designs. Uniquely, our model can be applied in settings when only partial or no genotype information is available. Using simulations based on synthetic mixtures and results on real data, we demonstrate the robustness of our model and illustrate the utility of multi-sample experimental designs for common expression analyses.	906	2.4804928131416837	3	22	4	0.004415011037527594	31.98
10.1101/599654	FALSE	TRUE	Optimal marker gene selection for cell type discrimination in single cell analyses	2019-04-04	Single-cell technologies characterize complex cell populations across multiple data modalities at un-precedented scale and resolution. Multi-omic data for single cell gene expression,in situhybridization, or single cell chromatin states are increasingly available across diverse tissue types. When isolating specific cell types from a sample of disassociated cells or performingin situsequencing in collections of heterogeneous cells, one challenging task is to select a small set of informative markers to identify and differentiate specific cell types or cell states as precisely as possible. Given single cell RNA-seq data and a set of cellular labels to discriminate, scGene-Fit selects gene transcript markers that jointly optimize cell label recovery using label-aware compressive classification methods, resulting in a substantially more robust and less redundant set of markers than existing methods. When applied to a data set given a hierarchy of cell type labels, the markers found by our method enable the recovery of the label hierarchy through a computationally efficient and principled optimization.	906	2.4804928131416837	4	17	5	0.005518763796909493	38.884

However, with the exception of the circadian clock and cell cycle, only a few such genes are known. Detecting oscillatory genes from snapshot single-cell experiments is a challenging task due to the lack of time information. Oscope is a recently proposed method to identify co-oscillatory gene pairs using single-cell RNA-seq data. Although promising, the current implementation of Oscope does not provide a principled statistical criterion for selecting oscillatory genes.We improve the optimisation scheme underlying Oscope and provide a well-calibrated non-parametric hypothesis test to select oscillatory genes at a given FDR threshold. We evaluate performance on synthetic data and three real datasets and show that our approach is more sensitive than the original Oscope formulation, discovering larger sets of known oscillators while-avoiding the need for less interpretable thresholds. We also describe how our proposed pseudo-time estimation method is more accurate in recovering the true cell order for each gene cluster while-requiring substantially less computation time than the extended nearest insertion approach.OscoNet is a robust and versatile approach to detect oscillatory gene networks from snapshot single-cell data addressing many of the limitations of the original Oscope method.	901	2.4668035592060233	5	21	0	0	12.93
10.1101/603589	FALSE	TRUE	Exploring dimension-reduced embeddings with Sleepwalk	2019-04-12	Dimension-reduction methods, such as t-SNE or UMAP, are widely used when exploring high-dimensional data describing many entities, e.g., RNA-seq data for many single cells. However, dimension reduction is commonly prone to introducing artefacts, and we hence need means to see where a dimension-reduced embedding is a faithful representation of the local neighbourhood and where it is not.We present Sleepwalk, a simple but powerful tool that allows the user to interactively explore an embedding, using colour to depict original or any other distances from all points to the cell under the mouse cursor. We show how this approach not only highlights distortions, but also reveals otherwise hidden characteristics of the data, and how Sleep-walk’s comparative modes help integrate multi-sample data and understand differences between embedding and preprocessing methods. Sleepwalk is a versatile and intuitive tool that unlocks the full power of dimension reduction and will be of value not only in single-cell RNA-seq but also in any other area with matrix-shaped big data.	898	2.458590006844627	2	44	0	0	87.8
10.1101/611517	FALSE	TRUE	Regulatory network-based imputation of dropouts in single-cell RNA sequencing data	2019-04-22	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods are typically unable to quantify the expression levels of all genes in a cell, creating a need for the computational prediction of missing values (‘dropout imputation’). Most existing dropout imputation methods are limited in the sense that they exclusively use the scRNA-seq dataset at hand and do not exploit external gene-gene relationship information. Further, it is unknown if all genes equally benefit from imputation or which imputation method works best for a given gene.Here, we show that a transcriptional regulatory network learned from external, independent gene expression data improves dropout imputation. Using a variety of human scRNA-seq datasets we demonstrate that our network-based approach outperforms published state-of-the-art methods. The network-based approach performs particularly well for lowly expressed genes, including cell-type-specific transcriptional regulators. Further, the cell-to-cell variation of 12.6% to 48.2% of the genes could not be adequately imputed by any of the methods that we tested. In those cases gene expression levels were best predicted by the mean expression across all cells, i.e. assuming no measurable expression variation between cells. These findings suggest that different imputation methods are optimal for different genes. We thus implemented an R-package called ADImpute (available via Bioconductor https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ADImpute.html) that automatically determines the best imputation method for each gene in a dataset.Our work represents a paradigm shift by demonstrating that there is no single best imputation method. Instead, we propose that imputation should maximally exploit external information and be adapted to gene-specific features, such as expression level and expression variation across cells.Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows for gene expression to be quantified in individual cells and thus plays a critical role in revealing differences between cells within tissues and characterizing them in healthy and pathological conditions. Because scRNA-seq captures the RNA content of individual cells, lowly expressed genes, for which few RNA molecules are present in the cell, are easily missed. These events are called ‘dropouts’ and considerably hinder analysis of the resulting data. In this work, we propose to make use of gene-gene relationships, learnt from external and more complete datasets, to estimate the true expression of genes that could not be quantified in a given cell. We show that this approach generally outperforms previously published methods, but also that different genes are better estimated with different methods. To allow the community to use our proposed method and combine it with existing ones, we created the R package ADImpute, available through Bioconductor.	888	2.431211498973306	3	30	4	0.0045045045045045045	9.85
10.1101/616862	FALSE	TRUE	PanoView: An iterative clustering for single-cell RNA sequencing data	2019-04-23	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides new opportunities to gain a mechanistic understanding of many biological processes. Current approaches for single cell clustering are often sensitive to the input parameters and have difficulty dealing with cell types with different densities. Here, we present Panoramic View (PanoView), an iterative method integrated with a novel density-based clustering, Ordering Local Maximum by Convex hull (OLMC), that uses a heuristic approach to estimate the required parameters based on the input data structures. In each iteration, PanoView will identify the most confident cell clusters and repeat the clustering with the remaining cells in a new PCA space. Without adjusting any parameter in PanoView, we demonstrated that PanoView was able to detect major and rare cell types simultaneously and outperformed other existing methods in both simulated datasets and published single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets. Finally, we conducted scRNA-Seq analysis of embryonic mouse hypothalamus, and PanoView was able to reveal known cell types and several rare cell subpopulations.One of the important tasks in analyzing single-cell transcriptomics data is to classify cell subpopulations. Most computational methods require users to input parameters and sometimes the proper parameters are not intuitive to users. Hence, a robust but easy-to-use method is of great interest. We proposed PanoView algorithm that utilizes an iterative approach to search cell clusters in an evolving three-dimension PCA space. The goal is to identify the cell cluster with the most confidence in each iteration and repeat the clustering algorithm with the remaining cells in a new PCA space. To cluster cells in a given PCA space, we also developed OLMC clustering to deal with clusters with varying densities. We examined the performance of PanoView in comparison to other existing methods using ten published single-cell datasets and simulated datasets as the ground truth. The results showed that PanoView is an easy-to-use and reliable tool and can be applied to diverse types of single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets.	887	2.428473648186174	6	39	0	0	3.35

The latest methods are scalable to thousands of cells, enabling in-depth characterization of sample composition without prior knowledge. However, there are important differences between scRNA-seq techniques, and it remains unclear which are the most suitable protocols for drawing cell atlases of tissues, organs and organisms. We have generated benchmark datasets to systematically evaluate techniques in terms of their power to comprehensively describe cell types and states. We performed a multi-center study comparing 13 commonly used single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq protocols using a highly heterogeneous reference sample resource. Comparative and integrative analysis at cell type and state level revealed marked differences in protocol performance, highlighting a series of key features for cell atlas projects. These should be considered when defining guidelines and standards for international consortia, such as the Human Cell Atlas project.	867	2.3737166324435317	39	42	15	0.01730103806228374	307.68
10.1101/631705	FALSE	TRUE	Cerebro: Interactive visualization of scRNA-seq data	2019-05-08	Despite the growing availability of sophisticated bioinformatic methods for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data, few tools exist that allow biologists without bioinformatic expertise to directly visualize and interact with their own data and results. Here, we present Cerebro (cell report browser), a Shiny- and Electron-based standalone desktop application for macOS and Windows, which allows investigation and inspection of pre-processed single-cell transcriptomics data without requiring bioinformatic experience of the user.Through an interactive and intuitive graphical interface, users can i) explore similarities and heterogeneity between samples and cells clusters in 2D or 3D projections such as t-SNE or UMAP, ii) display the expression level of single genes or genes sets of interest, iii) browse tables of most expressed genes and marker genes for each sample and cluster.We provide a simple example to show how Cerebro can be used and which are its capabilities. Through a focus on flexibility and direct access to data and results, we think Cerebro offers a collaborative framework for bioinformaticians and experimental biologists which facilitates effective interaction to shorten the gap between analysis and interpretation of the data.Cerebro and example data sets are available at https://github.com/romanhaa/Cerebro.

10.1101/632216	FALSE	TRUE	Systematic comparative analysis of single cell RNA-sequencing methods	2019-05-09	A multitude of single-cell RNA sequencing methods have been developed in recent years, with dramatic advances in scale and power, and enabling major discoveries and large scale cell mapping efforts. However, these methods have not been systematically and comprehensively benchmarked. Here, we directly compare seven methods for single cell and/or single nucleus profiling from three types of samples – cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and brain tissue – generating 36 libraries in six separate experiments in a single center. To analyze these datasets, we developed and applied scumi, a flexible computational pipeline that can be used for any scRNA-seq method. We evaluated the methods for both basic performance and for their ability to recover known biological information in the samples. Our study will help guide experiments with the methods in this study as well as serve as a benchmark for future studies and for computational algorithm development.	871	2.3846680355920604	22	63	43	0.04936854190585534	97.94

In this work, we present CellO, a machine learning-based tool for annotating human RNA-seq data with the Cell Ontology. CellO enables accurate and standardized cell type classification by considering the rich hierarchical structure of known cell types, a source of prior knowledge that is not utilized by existing methods. Furthemore, CellO comes pre-trained on a novel, comprehensive dataset of human, healthy, untreated primary samples in the Sequence Read Archive, which to the best of our knowledge, is the most diverse curated collection of primary cell data to date. CellO’s comprehensive training set enables it to run out-of-the-box on diverse cell types and achieves superior or competitive performance when compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, CellO’s linear models are easily interpreted, thereby enabling exploration of cell type-specific expression signatures across the ontology. To this end, we also present the CellO Viewer: a web application for exploring CellO’s models across the ontology.We present CellO, a tool for hierarchically classifying cell type from single-cell RNA-seq data against the graph-structured Cell OntologyCellO is pre-trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising nearly all bulk RNA-seq primary cell samples in the Sequence Read ArchiveCellO achieves superior or comparable performance with existing methods while featuring a more comprehensive pre-packaged training setCellO is built with easily interpretable models which we expose through a novel web application, the CellO Viewer, for exploring cell type-specific signatures across the Cell Ontology	870	2.3819301848049284	4	43	3	0.0034482758620689655	25.2

We present Spectrum, a fast spectral clustering method for single and multi-omic expression data. Spectrum is flexible and performs well on single-cell RNA-seq data. The method uses a new density-aware kernel that adapts to data scale and density. It uses a tensor product graph data integration and diffusion technique to reveal underlying structures and reduce noise.

We presentBERMUDA(Batch-Effect ReMoval Using Deep Autoencoders) — a novel transfer-learning-based method for batch-effect correction in scRNA-seq data.BERMUDAeffectively combines different batches of scRNA-seq data with vastly different cell population compositions and amplifies biological signals by transferring information among batches.

10.1101/642926	FALSE	TRUE	Benchmarking algorithms for gene regulatory network inference from single-cell transcriptomic data	2019-05-20	We present a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art algorithms for inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from single-cell gene expression data. We develop a systematic framework called BEELINE for this purpose. We use synthetic networks with predictable cellular trajectories as well as curated Boolean models to serve as the ground truth for evaluating the accuracy of GRN inference algorithms. We develop a strategy to simulate single-cell gene expression data from these two types of networks that avoids the pitfalls of previously-used methods. We selected 12 representative GRN inference algorithms. We found that the accuracy of these methods (measured in terms of AUROC and AUPRC) was moderate, by and large, although the methods were better in recovering interactions in the synthetic networks than the Boolean models. Techniques that did not require pseudotime-ordered cells were more accurate, in general. The observation that the endpoints of many false positive edges were connected by paths of length two in the Boolean models suggested that indirect effects may be predominant in the outputs of the algorithms we tested. The predicted networks were considerably inconsistent with each other, indicating that combining GRN inference algorithms using ensembles is likely to be challenging. Based on the results, we present some recommendations to users of GRN inference algorithms, including suggestions on how to create simulated gene expression datasets for testing them. BEELINE, which is available at http://github.com/murali-group/BEELINE under an open-source license, will aid in the future development of GRN inference algorithms for single-cell transcriptomic data.	860	2.3545516769336072	5	42	8	0.009302325581395349	52.9

10.1101/648683	FALSE	TRUE	Algorithms for efficiently collapsing reads with Unique Molecular Identifiers	2019-05-24	Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMI) are used in many experiments to find and remove PCR duplicates. Although there are many tools for solving the problem of deduplicating reads based on their finding reads with the same alignment coordinates and UMIs, many tools either cannot handle substitution errors, or require expensive pairwise UMI comparisons that do not efficiently scale to larger datasets.We formulate the problem of deduplicating UMIs in a manner that enables optimizations to be made, and more efficient data structures to be used. We implement our data structures and optimizations in a tool called UMICollapse, which is able to deduplicate over one million unique UMIs of length 9 at a single alignment position in around 26 seconds.We present a new formulation of the UMI deduplication problem, and show that it can be solved faster, with more sophisticated data structures.	856	2.3436002737850785	1	21	0	0	114.28
10.1101/655365	FALSE	TRUE	Accurate denoising of single-cell RNA-Seq data using unbiased principal component analysis	2019-06-03	Single-cell RNA-Seq measurements are commonly affected by high levels of technical noise, posing challenges for data analysis and visualization. A diverse array of methods has been proposed to computationally remove noise by sharing information across similar cells or genes, however their respective accuracies have been difficult to establish. Here, we propose a simple denoising strategy based on principal component analysis (PCA). We show that while PCA performed on raw data is biased towards highly expressed genes, this bias can be mitigated with a cell aggregation step, allowing the recovery of denoised expression values for both highly and lowly expressed genes. We benchmark our resulting ENHANCE algorithm and three previously described methods on simulated data that closely mimic real datasets, showing that ENHANCE provides the best overall denoising accuracy, recovering modules of co-expressed genes and cell subpopulations. Implementations of our algorithm are available at https://github.com/yanailab/enhance.	846	2.316221765913758	3	31	14	0.016548463356973995	43.414
10.1101/655753	FALSE	TRUE	Combinatorial prediction of marker panels from single-cell transcriptomic data	2019-05-30	Single-cell transcriptomic studies are identifying novel cell populations with exciting functional roles in various in vivo contexts, but identification of succinct gene-marker panels for such populations remains a challenge. In this work we introduce COMET, a computational framework for the identification of candidate marker panels consisting of one or more genes for cell populations of interest identified with single-cell RNA-seq data. We show that COMET outperforms other methods for the identification of single-gene panels, and enables, for the first time, prediction of multi-gene marker panels ranked by relevance. Staining by flow-cytometry assay confirmed the accuracy of COMET’s predictions in identifying marker-panels for cellular subtypes, at both the single- and multi-gene levels, validating COMET’s applicability and accuracy in predicting favorable marker-panels from transcriptomic input. COMET is a general non-parametric statistical framework and can be used as-is on various high-throughput datasets in addition to single-cell RNA-sequencing data. COMET is available for use via a web interface (http://www.cometsc.com) or a standalone software package (https://github.com/MSingerlab/COMETSC).	850	2.327173169062286	7	46	3	0.0035294117647058825	32.13
10.1101/655795	FALSE	TRUE	A Compositional Model to Assess Expression Changes from Single-Cell Rna-Seq Data	2019-05-31	On the problem of scoring genes for evidence of changes in the distribution of single-cell expression, we introduce an empirical Bayesian mixture approach and evaluate its operating characteristics in a range of numerical experiments. The proposed approach leverages cell-subtype structure revealed in cluster analysis in order to boost gene-level information on expression changes. Cell clustering informs gene-level analysis through a specially-constructed prior distribution over pairs of multinomial probability vectors; this prior meshes with available model-based tools that score patterns of differential expression over multiple subtypes. We derive an explicit formula for the posterior probability that a gene has the same distribution in two cellular conditions, allowing for a gene-specific mixture over subtypes in each condition. Advantage is gained by the compositional structure of the model, in which a host of gene-specific mixture components are allowed, but also in which the mixing proportions are constrained at the whole cell level. This structure leads to a novel form of information sharing through which the cell-clustering results support gene-level scoring of differential distribution. The result, according to our numerical experiments, is improved sensitivity compared to several standard approaches for detecting distributional expression changes.	849	2.324435318275154	4	49	4	0.004711425206124852	13.18
10.1101/657619	FALSE	TRUE	A mechanistic model for the negative binomial distribution of single-cell mRNA counts	2019-06-03	Several tools analyze the outcome of single-cell RNA-seq experiments, and they often assume a probability distribution for the observed sequencing counts. It is an open question of which is the most appropriate discrete distribution, not only in terms of model estimation, but also regarding interpretability, complexity and biological plausibility of inherent assumptions. To address the question of interpretability, we investigate mechanistic transcription and degradation models underlying commonly used discrete probability distributions. Known bottom-up approaches infer steady-state probability distributions such as Poisson or Poisson-beta distributions from different underlying transcription-degradation models. By turning this procedure upside down, we show how to infer a corresponding biological model from a given probability distribution, here the negative binomial distribution. Realistic mechanistic models underlying this distributional assumption are unknown so far. Our results indicate that the negative binomial distribution arises as steady-state distribution from a mechanistic model that produces mRNA molecules in bursts. We empirically show that it provides a convenient trade-off between computational complexity and biological simplicity.	846	2.316221765913758	3	51	13	0.015366430260047281	24.23

We propose scMAGeCK, a computational framework to systematically identify genes and non-coding elements associated with multiple expression-based phenotypes in single-cell CRISPR screening. scMAGeCK identified genes and enhancers that modulate the expression of a known proliferation marker, MKI67 (Ki-67), a result that resembles the outcome of proliferation-linked CRISPR screening. We further performed single-cell CRISPR screening on mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC), and identified key genes associated with different pluripotency states. scMAGeCK enabled an unbiased construction of genotype-phenotype network, where multiple phenotypes can be regulated by different gene perturbations. Finally, we studied key factors that improve the statistical power of single-cell CRISPR screens, including target gene expression and the number of guide RNAs (gRNAs) per cell. Collectively, scMAGeCK is a novel and effective computational tool to study genotype-phenotype relationships at a single-cell level.	846	2.316221765913758	8	47	1	0.001182033096926714	21.2

To enable such temporal analysis from multimodal single-cell experiments, we introduce an extension of the RNA velocity method that leverages estimates of unprocessed transcript and protein abundances to extrapolate cell states.

Existing imputation methods do not distinguish these two types of zeros. We present a modest imputation method scRecover to only impute the dropout zeros. It estimates the zero dropout probability of each gene in each cell, and predicts the number of truly expressed genes in the cell. scRecover is combined with other imputation methods like scImpute, SAVER and MAGIC to fulfil the imputation. Down-sampling experiments show that it recovers dropout zeros with higher accuracy and avoids over-imputing true zero values. Experiments on real data illustrate scRecover improves downstream analysis and visualization.	836	2.2888432580424367	3	31	6	0.007177033492822967	13.38

Single-cell RNA profiling allows the detection of bifurcations. However, while current methods capture these events, they do not identify characteristic gene signals. Here we show that BioTIP – a tipping-point theory-based analysis – can accurately, robustly, and reliably identify critical transition signals (CTSs). A CTS is a small group of genes with high covariance in expression that mark the cells approaching a bifurcation. We validated its accuracy in the cardiogenesis with known a tipping point and demonstrated the identified CTSs contain verified differentiation-driving transcription factors. We then demonstrated the application on a published mouse gastrulation dataset, validated the predicted CTSs using independent in-vivo samples, and inferred the key developing mesoderm regulator Etv2. Taken together, BioTIP is broadly applicable for the characterization of the plasticity, heterogeneity, and rapid switches in developmental processes, particularly in single-cell data analysis.Identifying significant critical transition signals (CTSs) from expression noiseA significant CTS contains or is targeted by key transcription factorsBioTIP identifies CTSs accurately and independent of trajectory topologiesSignificant CTSs reproducibly indicate bifurcations across datasets	837	2.291581108829569	9	63	0	0	2.25
10.1101/669739	FALSE	TRUE	Batch Effect Correction of RNA-seq Data through Sample Distance Matrix Adjustment	2019-06-13	Batch effect is a frequent challenge in deep sequencing data analysis that can lead to misleading conclusions. We present scBatch, a numerical algorithm that conducts batch effect correction on the count matrix of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Different from traditional methods, scBatch starts with establishing an ideal correction of the sample distance matrix that effectively reflect the underlying biological subgroups, without considering the actual correction of the raw count matrix itself. It then seeks an optimal linear transformation of the count matrix to approximate the established sample pattern. The benefit of such an approach is the final result is not restricted by assumptions on the mechanism of the batch effect. As a result, the method yields good clustering and gene differential expression (DE) results. We compared the new method, scBatch, with leading batch effect removal methods ComBat and mnnCorrect on simulated data, real bulk RNA-seq data, and real single-cell RNA-seq data. The comparisons demonstrated that scBatch achieved better sample clustering and DE gene detection results.	836	2.2888432580424367	2	27	1	0.0011961722488038277	12.28
10.1101/669911	FALSE	TRUE	Accurate estimation of cell composition in bulk expression through robust integration of single-cell information	2019-06-15	We present Bisque, a tool for estimating cell type proportions in bulk expression. Bisque implements a regression-based approach that utilizes single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data to generate a reference expression profile and learn gene-specific bulk expression transformations to robustly decompose RNA-seq data. These transformations significantly improve decomposition performance compared to existing methods when there is significant technical variation in the generation of the reference profile and observed bulk expression. Importantly, compared to existing methods, our approach is extremely efficient, making it suitable for the analysis of large genomic datasets that are becoming ubiquitous. When applied to subcutaneous adipose and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex expression datasets with both bulk RNA-seq and single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data, Bisque was able to replicate previously reported associations between cell type proportions and measured phenotypes across abundant and rare cell types. Bisque requires a single-cell reference dataset that reflects physiological cell type composition and can further leverage datasets that includes both bulk and single cell measurements over the same samples for improved accuracy. We further propose an additional mode of operation that merely requires a set of known marker genes.

10.1101/672261	FALSE	TRUE	SMNN: Batch Effect Correction for Single-cell RNA-seq data via Supervised Mutual Nearest Neighbor Detection	2019-06-17	Batch effect correction has been recognized to be indispensable when integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from multiple batches. State-of-the-art methods ignore single-cell cluster label information, but such information can improve effectiveness of batch effect correction, particularly under realistic scenarios where biological differences are not orthogonal to batch effects. To address this issue, we propose SMNN for batch effect correction of scRNA-seq data via supervised mutual nearest neighbor detection. Our extensive evaluations in simulated and real datasets show that SMNN provides improved merging within the corresponding cell types across batches, leading to reduced differentiation across batches over MNN, Seurat v3, and LIGER. Furthermore, SMNN retains more cell type-specific features, partially manifested by differentially expressed genes identified between cell types after SMNN correction being biologically more relevant, with precision improving by up to 841%.Batch effect correction has been recognized to be critical when integrating scRNA-seq data from multiple batches due to systematic differences in time points, generating laboratory and/or handling technician(s), experimental protocol, and/or sequencing platform.Existing batch effect correction methods that leverages information from mutual nearest neighbors across batches (for example, implemented in SC3 or Seurat) ignore cell type information and suffer from potentially mismatching single cells from different cell types across batches, which would lead to undesired correction results, especially under the scenario where variation from batch effects is non-negligible compared with biological effects.To address this critical issue, here we present SMNN, a supervised machine learning method that first takes cluster/cell-type label information from users or inferred from scRNA-seq clustering, and then searches mutual nearest neighbors within each cell type instead of global searching.Our SMNN method shows clear advantages over three state-of-the-art batch effect correction methods and can better mix cells of the same cell type across batches and more effectively recover cell-type specific features, in both simulations and real datasets.	832	2.2778918548939084	6	29	2	0.002403846153846154	21.73

Common approaches for identifying marker genes are based on pairwise statistical testing for differential gene expression between cell-types in heterogeneous cell populations, which is challenging due to unequal sample sizes and variance between groups resulting in little statistical power and inflated type I errors.We developed an alternative feature extraction method, Marker gene Identification for Cell-type Identity (MICTI) that encodes the cell-type specific expression information to each gene in every single-cell. This approach identifies features (genes) that are cell-type specific for a given cell-type in heterogeneous cell population. To validate this approach, we used (i) simulated single cell RNA-seq data, (ii) human pancreatic islet single-cell RNA-seq data and (iii) a simulated mixture of human single-cell RNA-seq data related to immune cells, particularly B cells, CD4+ memory cells, CD8+ memory cells, dendritic cells, fibroblast cells, and lymphoblast cells. For all cases, we were able to identify established cell-type-specific markers.Our approach represents a highly efficient and fast method as an alternative to differential expression analysis for molecular marker identification in heterogeneous single-cell RNA-seq data.	821	2.2477754962354553	4	45	1	0.001218026796589525	2.6
10.1101/696724	FALSE	TRUE	Mapping Vector Field of Single Cells	2019-07-09	Single-cell RNA-seq, together with RNA velocity and metabolic labeling, reveals cellular states and transitions at unprecedented resolution. Fully exploiting these data, however, requires dynamical models capable of predicting cell fate and unveiling the governing regulatory mechanisms. Here, we introduce dynamo, an analytical framework that reconciles intrinsic splicing and labeling kinetics to estimate absolute RNA velocities, reconstructs velocity vector fields that predict future cell fates, and finally employs differential geometry analyses to elucidate the underlying regulatory networks. We applied dynamo to a wide range of disparate biological processes including prediction of future states of differentiating hematopoietic stem cell lineages, deconvolution of glucocorticoid responses from orthogonal cell-cycle progression, characterization of regulatory networks driving zebrafish pigmentation, and identification of possible routes of resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our work thus represents an important step in going from qualitative, metaphorical conceptualizations of differentiation, as exemplified by Waddington’s epigenetic landscape, to quantitative and predictive theories.	810	2.217659137577002	15	87	14	0.01728395061728395	99.98
10.1101/697151	FALSE	TRUE	Reconstructing temporal and spatial dynamics in single-cell experiments	2019-07-09	Modern cytometry methods allow collecting complex, multi-dimensional data sets from heterogeneous cell populations at single-cell resolution. While methods exist to describe the progression and order of cellular processes from snapshots of such populations, these descriptions are limited to arbitrary pseudotime scales. Here we describe MAPiT, an universal transformation method that recovers real-time dynamics of cellular processes from pseudotime scales. As use cases, we applied MAPiT to two prominent problems in the flow-cytometric analysis of heterogeneous cell populations: (1) recovering the kinetics of cell cycle progression in unsynchronized and thus unperturbed cell populations, and (2) recovering the spatial arrangement of cells within multi-cellular spheroids prior to spheroid dissociation for cytometric analysis. Since MAPiT provides a theoretic basis for the relation of pseudotime values to real temporal and spatial scales, it can be used broadly in the analysis of cellular processes with snapshot data from heterogeneous cell populations.	810	2.217659137577002	6	29	0	0	11.08
10.1101/699637	FALSE	TRUE	souporcell: Robust clustering of single cell RNAseq by genotype and ambient RNA inference without reference genotypes	2019-07-14	Methods to deconvolve single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data are necessary for samples containing a natural mixture of genotypes and for scRNAseq experiments that multiplex cells from different donors1. Multiplexing across donors is a popular experimental design with many benefits including avoiding batch effects2, reducing costs, and improving doublet detection. Using variants detected in the RNAseq reads, it is possible to assign cells to the individuals from which they arose. These variants can also be used to identify and remove cross-genotype doublet cells that may have highly similar transcriptional profiles precluding detection by transcriptional profile. More subtle cross-genotype variant contamination can be used to estimate the amount of ambient RNA in the system. Ambient RNA is caused by cell lysis prior to droplet partitioning and is an important confounder of scRNAseq analysis3. Souporcell is a novel method to cluster cells using only the genetic variants detected within the scRNAseq reads. We show that it achieves high accuracy on genotype clustering, doublet detection, and ambient RNA estimation as demonstrated across a wide range of challenging scenarios.	805	2.2039698836413417	8	21	9	0.011180124223602485	54.98
10.1101/699959	FALSE	TRUE	Enhancing single-cell cellular state inference by incorporating molecular network features	2019-07-14	In biological systems, genes function in conjunction rather than in isolation. However, traditional single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analyses heavily rely on the transcriptional similarity of individual genes, ignoring the inherent gene-gene interactions. Here, we present SCORE, a network-based method, which incorporates the validated molecular network features to infer cellular states. Using real scRNA-seq datasets, SCORE outperforms existing methods in accuracy, robustness, scalability, data integration and removal of batch effect. When applying SCORE to a newly generated human ileal scRNA-seq dataset, we identified several novel stem/progenitor clusters, including a Cripto-1+ cluster. Moreover, two distinct groups of goblet cells were identified and only one of them tended to secrete mucus. Besides, we found that the recently identified BEST4+OTOP2+ microfold cells also highly expressed CFTR, which is different from their colonic counterparts. In summary, SCORE enhances cellular state inference by simulating the dynamic changes of molecular networks, providing more biological insights beyond statistical interpretations.	805	2.2039698836413417	15	35	3	0.0037267080745341614	10.08

We benchmark RNA-Bloom’s performance against leading bulk RNA-seq assembly approaches, and illustrate its utility in detecting cell-specific gene fusion events using sequencing data from HiSeq-4000 and BGISEQ-500 platforms. We expect RNA-Bloom to boost the utility of scRNA-seq data, expanding what is informatically accessible now.	805	2.2039698836413417	7	28	4	0.004968944099378882	13.784
10.1101/713008	FALSE	TRUE	SCelVis: Powerful explorative single cell data analysis on the desktop and in the cloud	2019-07-24	Single cell omics technologies present unique opportunities for biomedical and life sciences from lab to clinic, but the high dimensional nature of such data poses challenges for computational analysis and interpretation. Furthermore, FAIR data management as well as data privacy and security become crucial when working with clinical data, especially in cross-institutional and translational settings. Existing solutions are either bound to the desktop of one researcher or come with dependencies on vendor-specific technology for cloud storage or user authentication.To facilitate analysis and interpretation of single-cell data by users without bioinformatics expertise, we present SCelVis, a flexible, interactive and user-friendly app for web-based visualization of pre-processed single-cell data. Users can survey multiple interactive visualizations of their single cell expression data and cell annotation, and download raw or processed data for further offline analysis. SCelVis can be run both on the desktop and cloud systems, accepts input from local and various remote sources using standard and open protocols, and allows for hosting data in the cloud and locally.SCelVis is implemented in Python using Dash by Plotly. It is available as a standalone application as a Python package, via Conda/Bioconda and as a Docker image. All components are available as open source under the permissive MIT license and are based on open standards and interfaces, enabling further development and integration with third party pipelines and analysis components.

10.1101/713412	FALSE	TRUE	On the discovery of subpopulation-specific state transitions from multi-sample multi-condition single-cell RNA sequencing data	2019-07-26	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has quickly become an empowering technology to profile the transcriptomes of individual cells on a large scale. Many early analyses of differential expression have aimed at identifying differences between subpopulations, and thus are focused on finding subpopulation markers either in a single sample or across multiple samples. More generally, such methods can compare expression levels in multiple sets of cells, thus leading to cross-condition analyses. However, given the emergence of replicated multi-condition scRNA-seq datasets, an area of increasing focus is making sample-level inferences, termed here as differential state analysis. For example, one could investigate the condition-specific responses of cell subpopulations measured from patients from each condition; however, it is not clear which statistical framework best handles this situation. In this work, we surveyed the methods available to perform cross-condition differential state analyses, including cell-level mixed models and methods based on aggregated “pseudobulk” data. We developed a flexible simulation platform that mimics both single and multi-sample scRNA-seq data and provide robust tools for multi-condition analysis within the muscat R package.	793	2.1711156741957565	8	69	28	0.03530895334174023	93.58
10.1101/716811	FALSE	TRUE	A single-cell expression simulator guided by gene regulatory networks	2019-07-28	A common approach to benchmarking of single-cell transcriptomics tools is to generate synthetic data sets that resemble experimental data in their statistical properties. However, existing single-cell simulators do not incorporate known principles of transcription factor-gene regulatory interactions that underlie expression dynamics. Here we present SERGIO, a simulator of single-cell gene expression data that models the stochastic nature of transcription as well as linear and non-linear influences of multiple transcription factors on genes according to a user-provided gene regulatory network. SERGIO is capable of simulating any number of cell types in steady-state or cells differentiating to multiple fates according to a provided trajectory, reporting both unspliced and spliced transcript counts in single-cells. We show that data sets generated by SERGIO are comparable with experimental data in terms of multiple statistical measures. We also illustrate the use of SERGIO to benchmark several popular single-cell analysis tools, including GRN inference methods.	791	2.1656399726214923	2	69	6	0.007585335018963337	13.08
10.1101/718668	FALSE	TRUE	Probabilistic index models for testing differential expression in single cell RNA sequencing data	2019-07-30	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies profile gene expression patterns in individual cells. It is often of interest to test for differential expression (DE) between conditions, e.g. treatment vs control or between cell types. Simulation studies have shown that non-parametric tests, such as the Wilcoxon-rank sum test, can robustly detect significant DE, with better performance than many parametric tools specifically developed for scRNA-seq data analysis. However, these rank tests cannot be used for complex experimental designs involving multiple groups, multiple factors and confounding variables. Further, rank based tests do not provide an interpretable measure of the effect size. We propose a semi-parametric approach based on probabilistic index models (PIM) that form a flexible class of models that generalize classical rank tests. Our method does not rely on strong distributional assumptions and it allows accounting for confounding factors. Moreover, it allows for the estimation of the effect size in terms of a probabilistic index. Real data analysis demonstrate that PIM is capable of identifying biologically meaningful DE. Our simulation studies also show that DE tests succeed well in controlling the false discovery rate at its nominal level, while maintaining good sensitivity as compared to competing methods.	789	2.1601642710472277	3	35	0	0	0.75
10.1101/727867	FALSE	TRUE	scAEspy: a unifying tool based on autoencoders for the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data	2019-08-07	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) experiments are gaining ground to study the molecular processes that drive normal development as well as the onset of different pathologies. Finding an effective and efficient low-dimensional representation of the data is one of the most important steps in the downstream analysis of scRNA-Seq data, as it could provide a better identification of known or putatively novel cell-types. Another step that still poses a challenge is the integration of different scRNA-Seq datasets. Though standard computational pipelines to gain knowledge from scRNA-Seq data exist, a further improvement could be achieved by means of machine learning approaches.Autoencoders (AEs) have been effectively used to capture the non-linearities among gene interactions of scRNA-Seq data, so that the deployment of AE-based tools might represent the way forward in this context. We introduce here scAEspy, a unifying tool that embodies: (1) four of the most advanced AEs, (2) two novel AEs that we developed on purpose, (3) different loss functions. We show that scAEspy can be coupled with various batch-effect removal tools to integrate data by different scRNA-Seq platforms, in order to better identify the cell-types. We benchmarked scAEspy against the most used batch-effect removal tools, showing that our AE-based strategies outperform the existing solutions.scAEspy is a user-friendly tool that enables using the most recent and promising AEs to analyse scRNA-Seq data by only setting up two user-defined parameters. Thanks to its modularity, scAEspy can be easily extended to accommodate new AEs to further improve the downstream analysis of scRNA-Seq data. Considering the relevant results we achieved, scAEspy can be considered as a starting point to build a more comprehensive toolkit designed to integrate multi single-cell omics.	781	2.138261464750171	5	80	1	0.0012804097311139564	6.6
10.1101/731638	FALSE	TRUE	scDoc: Correcting Drop-out Events in Single-cell RNA-seq Data	2019-08-10	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become an important tool to unravel cellular heterogeneity, discover new cell types, and understand cell development at single-cell resolution. However, one major challenge to scRNA-seq research is the presence of “drop-out” events, which usually is due to extremely low mRNA input or the stochastic nature of gene expression. In this paper, we present a novel Single-Cell RNA-seq Drop-Out Correction (scDoc) method, imputing drop-out events by borrowing information for the same gene from highly similar cells. scDoc is the first method that involves drop-out information to account for cell-to-cell similarity estimation, which is crucial in scRNA-seq drop-out imputation but has not been appropriately examined. We evaluated the performance of scDoc using both simulated data and real scRNA-seq studies. Results show that scDoc can impute the drop-out events more accurately and robustly; specifically, it outperforms all available imputation methods in reference to data visualization, cell subpopulation identification, and differential expression detection in scRNA-seq data.	778	2.130047912388775	4	53	0	0	6.85

Statistical inference methods for such analyses must be scalable, and ideally interpretable. We present an approach based on a modification of a recently published highly scalable variational autoencoder framework that provides interpretability without sacrificing much accuracy. We demonstrate that our approach enables identification of gene programs in massive datasets. Our strategy, namely the learning of factor models with the auto-encoding variational Bayes framework, is not domain specific and may be of interest for other applications.	772	2.113620807665982	2	32	5	0.006476683937823834	41.03

We present SCATS (Single-Cell Analysis of Transcript Splicing) for differential alternative splicing (DAS) analysis for scRNA-seq data with or without unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). By modeling technical noise and grouping exons that originate from the same isoform(s), SCATS achieves high sensitivity to detect DAS events compared to Census, DEXSeq and MISO, and these events were confirmed by qRT-PCR experiment.	769	2.105407255304586	3	22	0	0	25.03
10.1101/746339	FALSE	TRUE	A multiresolution framework to characterize single-cell state landscapes	2019-08-24	Dissecting the cellular heterogeneity embedded in single-cell transcriptomic data is challenging. Although a large number of methods and approaches exist, robustly identifying underlying cell states and their associations is still a major challenge; given the nonexclusive and dynamic influence of multiple unknown sources of variability, the existence of state continuum at the time-scale of observation, and the inevitable snapshot nature of experiments. As a way to address some of these challenges, here we introduce ACTIONet, a comprehensive framework that combines archetypal analysis and network theory to provide a ready-to-use analytical approach for multiresolution single-cell state characterization. ACTIONet uses multilevel matrix decomposition and network reconstruction to simultaneously learn cell state patterns, quantify single-cell states, and reconstruct a reproducible structural representation of the transcriptional state space that is geometrically mapped to a color space. A color-enhanced quantitative view of cell states enables novel visualization, prediction, and annotation approaches. Using data from multiple tissues, organisms, and developmental conditions, we illustrate how ACTIONet facilitates the reconstruction and exploration of single-cell state landscapes.	764	2.0917180013689256	3	48	2	0.002617801047120419	5.5
10.1101/750612	FALSE	TRUE	scHLAcount: Allele-specific HLA expression from single-cell gene expression data	2019-08-29	Studies in bulk RNA sequencing data suggest cell-type and allele-specific expression of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. These loci are extremely diverse and they function as part of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) which is responsible for antigen presentation. Mutation and or misregulation of expression of HLA genes has implications in diseases, especially cancer. Immune responses to tumor cells can be evaded through HLA loss of function. However, bulk RNA-seq does not fully disentangle cell type specificity and allelic expression. Here we present scHLAcount, a workflow for computing allele-specific molecule counts of the HLA genes in single cells an individualized reference. We demonstrate that scHLAcount can be used to find cell-type specific allelic expression of HLA genes in blood cells, and detect different allelic expression patterns between tumor and normal cells in patient biopsies. scHLAcount is available at https://github.com/10XGenomics/scHLAcount.	759	2.078028747433265	5	24	0	0	34
10.1101/758524	FALSE	TRUE	Data-based RNA-seq Simulations by Binomial Thinning	2019-09-05	With the explosion in the number of methods designed to analyze bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data, there is a growing need for approaches that assess and compare these methods. The usual technique is to compare methods on data simulated according to some theoretical model. However, as real data often exhibit violations from theoretical models, this can result in un-substantiated claims of a method’s performance. Rather than generate data from a theoretical model, in this paper we develop methods to add signal to real RNA-seq datasets. Since the resulting simulated data are not generated from an unrealistic theoretical model, they exhibit realistic (annoying) attributes of real data. This lets RNA-seq methods developers assess their procedures in non-ideal (model-violating) scenarios. Our procedures may be applied to both single-cell and bulk RNA-seq. We show that our simulation method results in more realistic datasets and can alter the conclusions of a differential expression analysis study. We also demonstrate our approach by comparing various factor analysis techniques on RNA-seq datasets. Our tools are available in the seqgendiff R package on the Comprehensive R Archive Net-work: https://cran.r-project.org/package=seqgendiff.	752	2.0588637919233403	1	113	1	0.0013297872340425532	15.88

However, existing computational methods are inadequately scalable to large datasets and therefore cannot uncover the complex cellular heterogeneity.We introduce a highly scalable graph-based clustering algorithm PARC - phenotyping by accelerated refined community-partitioning – for ultralarge-scale, high-dimensional single-cell data (&gt; 1 million cells). Using large single cell mass cytometry, RNA-seq and imaging-based biophysical data, we demonstrate that PARC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art clustering algorithms without sub-sampling of cells, including Phenograph, FlowSOM, and Flock, in terms of both speed and ability to robustly detect rare cell populations. For example, PARC can cluster a single cell data set of 1.1M cells within 13 minutes, compared to &gt;2 hours to the next fastest graph-clustering algorithm, Phenograph. Our work presents a scalable algorithm to cope with increasingly large-scale single-cell analysis.https://github.com/ShobiStassen/PARC	746	2.0424366872005475	6	78	0	0	12.08
10.1101/772723	FALSE	TRUE	I-Impute: a self-consistent method to impute single cell RNA sequencing data	2019-09-18	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is essential for the study of cell-specific transcriptome landscapes. The scRNA-seq techniques capture merely a small fraction of the gene due to “dropout” events. When analyzing with scRNA-seq data, the dropout events receive intensive attentions. Imputation tools are proposed to estimate the values of the dropout events and de-noise the data. To evaluate the imputation tools, researchers have developed different clustering criteria by incorporating the ground-truth cell subgroup labels. There lack measurements without cell subgroup knowledge. A reliable imputation tool should follow the “self-consistency” principle; that is, the tool reports the results only if it finds no further errors or dropouts from the data. Here, we propose “self-consistency” as an explicit evaluation criterion; also, we propose I-Impute, a “self-consistent” method, to impute scRNA-seq data. I-Impute lever-ages continuous similarities and dropout probabilities and refines the data iteratively to make the final output self-consistent. On the in silico data sets, I-Impute exhibited the highest Pearson correlations for different dropout rates consistently compared with the state-of-art methods SAVER and scImpute. On the datasets of 90.87%, 70.98% and 56.65% zero rates, I-Impute exhibited the correlations as 0.78, 0.90, and 0.94, respectively, between ground truth entries and predicted values, while SAVER exhibited the correlations as 0.58, 0.79 and 0.88, respectively and scImpute exhibited correlations as 0.65, 0.86, and 0.93, respectively. Furthermore, we collected three wetlab datasets, mouse bladder cells dataset, embryonic stem cells dataset, and aortic leukocyte cells dataset, to evaluate the tools. I-Impute exhibited feasible cell subpopulation discovery efficacy on all the three datasets. It achieves the highest clustering accuracy compared with SAVER and scImpute; that is, I-Impute displayed the adjusted Rand indices of the three datasets as 0.61, 0.7, 0.52, which improved the indices of SAVER by 0.01 to 0.17, and improved the indices of scImpute by 0.19 to 0.4. Also, I-impute promoted normalized mutual information of the three datasets by 0.01 to 0.09 comparing with SAVER, and by 0.15 to 0.34 comparing with scImpute. I-Impute exhibits robust imputation ability and follows the “self-consistency” principle. It offers perspicacity to uncover the underlying cell subtypes in real scRNA-Seq data.

10.1101/773903	FALSE	TRUE	Autoencoder-based cluster ensembles for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis	2019-09-19	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a transformative technology, allowing global transcriptomes of individual cells to be profiled with high accuracy. An essential task in scRNA-seq data analysis is the identification of cell types from complex samples or tissues profiled in an experiment. To this end, clustering has become a key computational technique for grouping cells based on their transcriptome profiles, enabling subsequent cell type identification from each cluster of cells. Due to the high feature-dimensionality of the transcriptome (i.e. the large number of measured genes in each cell) and because only a small fraction of genes are cell type-specific and therefore informative for generating cell type-specific clusters, clustering directly on the original feature/gene dimension may lead to uninformative clusters and hinder correct cell type identification.Here, we propose an autoencoder-based cluster ensemble framework in which we first take random subspace projections from the data, then compress each random projection to a low-dimensional space using an autoencoder artificial neural network, and finally apply ensemble clustering across all encoded datasets for generating clusters of cells. We employ four evaluation metrics to benchmark clustering performance and our experiments demonstrate that the proposed autoencoder-based cluster ensemble can lead to substantially improved cell type-specific clusters when applied with both the standard k-means clustering algorithm and a state-of-the-art kernel-based clustering algorithm (SIMLR) designed specifically for scRNA-seq data. Compared to directly using these clustering algorithms on the original datasets, the performance improvement in some cases is up to 100%, depending on the evaluation metrics used.Our results suggest that the proposed framework can facilitate more accurate cell type identification as well as other downstream analyses.

Interestingly, AGM is the only one generating haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). To identify the difference between AGM and YS, we compared them using single-cell RNA sequencing between 9.5 and 11.5 days of mouse embryonic development and identified cell populations using CONCLUS, a new computational tool. The AGM was the only one containing neurons and a specific mesenchymal population, while the YS major component was an epithelial population expressing liver marker genes. In addition, the YS contained a major endothelial population expressing Stab2, a hyaluronan receptor, also highly expressed by liver endothelium. We demonstrated that the YS haematopoietic potential was restricted to Stab2-negative cells and that ectopic expression of Stab2 could reduce blood cell formation from endothelium. Our results indicate that the AGM is a tissue more favourable to HSCs development than the YS because of its microenvironment and the nature of its endothelial cells.	738	2.020533880903491	12	70	3	0.0040650406504065045	18.284

To capitalize on the large collections of well-annotated scRNA-seq datasets, we present scClassify, a hierarchical classification framework based on ensemble learning. scClassify can identify cells from published scRNA-seq datasets more accurately and more finely than in the original publications.

10.1101/786285	FALSE	TRUE	Enhancing droplet-based single-nucleus RNA-seq resolution using the semi-supervised machine learning classifier DIEM	2019-09-30	Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) measures gene expression in individual nuclei instead of cells, allowing for unbiased cell type characterization in solid tissues. Contrary to single-cell RNA seq (scRNA-seq), we observe that snRNA-seq is commonly subject to contamination by high amounts of extranuclear background RNA, which can lead to identification of spurious cell types in downstream clustering analyses if overlooked. We present a novel approach to remove debris-contaminated droplets in snRNA-seq experiments, called Debris Identification using Expectation Maximization (DIEM). Our likelihood-based approach models the gene expression distribution of debris and cell types, which are estimated using EM. We evaluated DIEM using three snRNA-seq data sets: 1) human differentiating preadipocytes in vitro, 2) fresh mouse brain tissue, and 3) human frozen adipose tissue (AT) from six individuals. All three data sets showed various degrees of extranuclear RNA contamination. We observed that existing methods fail to account for contaminated droplets and led to spurious cell types. When compared to filtering using these state of the art methods, DIEM better removed droplets containing high levels of extranuclear RNA and led to higher quality clusters. Although DIEM was designed for snRNA-seq data, we also successfully applied DIEM to single-cell data.

10.1101/788554	FALSE	TRUE	GiniClust3: a fast and memory-efficient tool for rare cell type identification	2019-10-07	With the rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing technology, it is possible to dissect cell-type composition at high resolution. A number of methods have been developed with the purpose to identify rare cell types. However, existing methods are still not scalable to large datasets, limiting their utility. To overcome this limitation, we present a new software package, called GiniClust3, which is an extension of GiniClust2 and significantly faster and memory-efficient than previous versions.Using GiniClust3, it only takes about 7 hours to identify both common and rare cell clusters from a dataset that contains more than one million cells. Cell type mapping and perturbation analyses show that GiniClust3 could robustly identify cell clusters.GiniCluster3 is implemented in the open-source python package, with source code freely available through the Github (https://github.com/rdong08/GiniClust3).gcyuan@jimmy.harvard.eduSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.	720	1.9712525667351128	2	21	1	0.001388888888888889	15.4
10.1101/788596	FALSE	TRUE	Fast searches of large collections of single cell data using scfind	2019-10-01	Single cell technologies have made it possible to profile millions of cells, but for these resources to be useful they must be easy to query and access. To facilitate interactive and intuitive access to single cell data we have developed scfind, a search engine for cell atlases. Using transcriptome data from mouse cell atlases we show how scfind can be used to evaluate marker genes, to perform in silico gating, and to identify both cell-type specific and housekeeping genes. Moreover, we have developed a subquery optimization routine to ensure that long and complex queries return meaningful results. To make scfind more user friendly and accessible, we use indices of PubMed abstracts and techniques from natural language processing to allow for arbitrary queries. Finally, we show how scfind can be used for multi-omics analyses by combining single-cell ATAC-seq data with transcriptome data.	726	1.9876796714579055	4	66	2	0.0027548209366391185	55.13
10.1101/791699	FALSE	TRUE	CellBender remove-background: a deep generative model for unsupervised removal of background noise from scRNA-seq datasets	2019-10-03	Droplet-based scRNA-seq assays are known to produce a significant amount of background RNA counts, the hallmark of which is non-zero transcript counts in presumably empty droplets. The presence of background RNA can lead to systematic biases and batch effects in various downstream analyses such as differential expression and marker gene discovery. In this paper, we explore the phenomenology and mechanisms of background RNA generation in droplet-based scRNA-seq assays and present a deep generative model of background-contaminated counts mirroring those mechanisms. The model is used for learning the background RNA profile, distinguishing cell-containing droplets from empty ones, and retrieving background-free gene expression profiles. We implement the model along with a fast and scalable inference algorithm as the remove-background module in CellBender, an open-source scRNA-seq data processing software package. Finally, we present simulations and investigations of several scRNA-seq datasets to show that processing raw data using CellBender significantly boosts the magnitude and specificity of differential expression across different cell types.	724	1.9822039698836413	3	21	34	0.04696132596685083	22.36
10.1101/794289	FALSE	TRUE	Deep Generative Models for Detecting Differential Expression in Single Cells	2019-10-04	Detecting differentially expressed genes is important for characterizing subpopulations of cells. However, in scRNA-seq data, nuisance variation due to technical factors like sequencing depth and RNA capture efficiency obscures the underlying biological signal. First, we show that deep generative models, which combined Bayesian statistics and deep neural networks, better estimate the log-fold-change in gene expression levels between subpopulations of cells. Second, we use Bayesian decision theory to detect differentially expressed genes while controlling the false discovery rate. Our experiments on simulated and real datasets show that our approach out-performs state-of-the-art DE frameworks. Finally, we introduce a technique for improving the posterior approximation, and show that it also improves differential expression performance.	723	1.9794661190965093	6	21	8	0.011065006915629323	24.83
10.1101/794503	FALSE	TRUE	Knowledge-primed neural networks enable biologically interpretable deep learning on single-cell sequencing data	2019-10-07	Deep learning has emerged as a powerful methodology for predicting a variety of complex biological phenomena. However, its utility for biological discovery has so far been limited, given that generic deep neural networks provide little insight into the biological mechanisms that underlie a successful prediction. Here we demonstrate deep learning on biological networks, where every node has a molecular equivalent (such as a protein or gene) and every edge has a mechanistic interpretation (e.g., a regulatory interaction along a signaling pathway).With knowledge-primed neural networks (KPNNs), we exploit the ability of deep learning algorithms to assign meaningful weights to multi-layered networks for interpretable deep learning. We introduce three methodological advances in the learning algorithm that enhance interpretability of the learnt KPNNs: Stabilizing node weights in the presence of redundancy, enhancing the quantitative interpretability of node weights, and controlling for the uneven connectivity inherent to biological networks. We demonstrate the power of our approach on two single-cell RNA-seq datasets, predicting T cell receptor stimulation in a standardizedin vitromodel and inferring cell type in Human Cell Atlas reference data comprising 483,084 immune cells.In summary, we introduce KPNNs as a method that combines the predictive power of deep learning with the interpretability of biological networks. While demonstrated here on single-cell sequencing data, this method is broadly relevant to other research areas where prior domain knowledge can be represented as networks.	720	1.9712525667351128	2	98	2	0.002777777777777778	56.88
10.1101/794875	FALSE	TRUE	Detecting Zero-Inflated Genes in Single-Cell Transcriptomics Data	2019-10-07	In single-cell RNA sequencing data, biological processes or technical factors may induce an overabundance of zero measurements. Existing probabilistic approaches to interpreting these data either model all genes as zero-inflated, or none. But the overabundance of zeros might be gene-specific. Hence, we propose the AutoZI model, which, for each gene, places a spike-and-slab prior on a mixture assignment between a negative binomial (NB) component and a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) component. We approximate the posterior distribution under this model using variational inference, and employ Bayesian decision theory to decide whether each gene is zero-inflated. On simulated data, AutoZI outperforms the alternatives. On negative control data, AutoZI retrieves predictions consistent to a previous study on ERCC spike-ins and recovers similar results on control RNAs. Applied to several datasets and instances of the 10x Chromium protocol, AutoZI allows both biological and technical interpretations of zero-inflation. Finally, AutoZI’s decisions on mouse embyronic stem-cells suggest that zero-inflation might be due to transcriptional bursting.	720	1.9712525667351128	6	17	4	0.005555555555555556	21
10.1101/799817	FALSE	TRUE	Fast and precise single-cell data analysis using hierarchical autoencoder	2019-10-10	A primary challenge in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies comes from the massive amount of data and the excess noise level. To address this challenge, we introduce a hierarchical autoencoder that reliably extracts representative information of each cell. In an extensive analysis, we demonstrate that the approach vastly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in many research sub-fields of scRNA-seq analysis, including cell segregation through unsupervised learning, visualization of transcriptome landscape, cell classification, and pseudo-time inference.	717	1.9630390143737166	6	56	3	0.0041841004184100415	41.03
10.1101/800490	FALSE	TRUE	scCancer: a package for automated processing of single cell RNA-seq data in cancer	2019-10-11	Molecular heterogeneities bring great challenges for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Recent advance in single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology make it possible to study cancer transcriptomic heterogeneities at single cell level. Here, we develop an R package named scCancer which focuses on processing and analyzing scRNA-seq data for cancer research. Except basic data processing steps, this package takes several special considerations for cancer-specific features. Firstly, the package introduced comprehensive quality control metrics. Secondly, it used a data-driven machine learning algorithm to accurately identify major cancer microenvironment cell populations. Thirdly, it estimated a malignancy score to classify malignant (cancerous) and non-malignant cells. Then, it analyzed intra-tumor heterogeneities by key cellular phenotypes (such as cell cycle and stemness) and gene signatures. Finally, a user-friendly graphic report was generated for all the analyses.http://lifeome.net/software/sccancer/.jgu@tsinghua.edu.cn	716	1.9603011635865846	5	8	1	0.0013966480446927375	8.95
10.1101/800847	FALSE	TRUE	Deciphering the transcriptomic landscape of tumor-infiltrating CD8 lymphocytes in B16 melanoma tumors with single-cell RNA-Seq	2019-10-10	Recent studies have proposed that tumor-specific tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD8 TIL) can be classified into two main groups: “exhausted” TILs, characterized by high expression of the inhibitory receptors PD-1 and TIM-3 and lack of transcription factor 1 (Tcf1); and “memory-like” TILs, with self-renewal capacity and co-expressing Tcf1 and PD-1. However, a comprehensive definition of the heterogeneity existing within both tumor-specific and total CD8 TILs has yet to be clearly established.To investigate this heterogeneity at the transcriptomic level, we performed paired single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing of CD8 T cells infiltrating B16 murine melanoma tumors, including cells of known tumor specificity. Unsupervised clustering and gene signature analysis revealed four distinct CD8 TIL states - exhausted, memory-like, naïve and effector memory-like (EM-like) - and predicted novel markers, including Ly6C for the EM-like cells, that were validated by flow cytometry. Tumor-specific PMEL T cells were predominantly found within the exhausted and memory-like states but also within the EM-like state. Further, TCR repertoire sequencing revealed a large clonal expansion of exhausted, memory-like and EM-like cells with partial clonal relatedness between them. Finally, meta-analyses of public bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data suggested that anti-PD-1 treatment induces expansion of EM-like cells.Our reference map of the transcriptomic landscape of murine CD8 TILs will help interpreting future bulk and single-cell transcriptomic studies and may guide the analysis of CD8 TIL subpopulations in response to therapeutic interventions.	717	1.9630390143737166	5	70	1	0.001394700139470014	16.45
10.1101/810234	FALSE	TRUE	Unifying single-cell annotations based on the Cell Ontology	2019-10-20	Single cell technologies have rapidly generated an unprecedented amount of data that enables us to understand biological systems at single-cell resolution. However, joint analysis of datasets generated by independent labs remains challenging due to a lack of consistent terminology to describe cell types. Here, we present OnClass, an algorithm and accompanying software for automatically classifying cells into cell types part of the controlled vocabulary that forms the Cell Ontology. A key advantage of OnClass is its capability to classify cells into cell types not present in the training data because it uses the Cell Ontology graph to infer cell type relationships. Furthermore, OnClass can be used to identify marker genes for all the cell ontology categories, independently of whether the cells types are present or absent in the training data, suggesting that OnClass can be used not only as an annotation tool for single cell datasets but also as an algorithm to identify marker genes specific to each term of the Cell Ontology, offering the possibility of refining the Cell Ontology using a data-centric approach.	707	1.9356605065023955	9	45	11	0.015558698727015558	34.03
10.1101/819581	FALSE	TRUE	ROGUE: an entropy-based universal metric for assessing the purity of single cell population	2019-10-27	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a versatile tool for discovering and annotating cell types and states, but the determination and annotation of cell subtypes is often subjective and arbitrary. Often, it is not even clear whether a given cluster is uniform. Here we present an entropy-based statistic, ROGUE, to accurately quantify the purity of identified cell clusters. We demonstrated that our ROGUE metric is generalizable across datasets, and enables accurate, sensitive and robust assessment of cluster purity on a wide range of simulated and real datasets. Applying this metric to fibroblast and B cell datasets, we identified additional subtypes and demonstrated the application of ROGUE-guided analyses to detect true signals in specific subpopulations. ROGUE can be applied to all tested scRNA-seq datasets, and has important implications for evaluating the quality of putative clusters, discovering pure cell subtypes and constructing comprehensive, detailed and standardized single cell atlas.	700	1.9164955509924708	5	50	2	0.002857142857142857	19.28
10.1101/820928	FALSE	TRUE	northstar: leveraging cell atlases to identify healthy and neoplastic cells in transcriptomes from human tumors	2019-10-27	Single cell transcriptomics is revolutionising our understanding of tissue and disease heterogeneity, yet cell type identificationl remains a partially manual task. Published algorithms for automatic cell annotation are limited to known cell types and fail to capture novel populations, especially cancer cells. We developed northstar, a computational approach to classify thousands of cells based on published data within seconds while simultaneously identifying and highlighting new cell states such as malignancies. We tested northstar on human glioblastoma and melanoma and obtained high accuracy and robustness. We collected eleven pancreatic tumors and identified three shared and five private neoplastic cell populations, offering insight into the origins of neuroendocrine and exocrine tumors. northstar is a useful tool to assign known and novel cell type and states in the age of cell atlases.	700	1.9164955509924708	8	35	2	0.002857142857142857	24
10.1101/820936	FALSE	TRUE	Generalizing RNA velocity to transient cell states through dynamical modeling	2019-10-29	The introduction of RNA velocity in single cells has opened up new ways of studying cellular differentiation. The originally proposed framework obtains velocities as the deviation of the observed ratio of spliced and unspliced mRNA from an inferred steady state. Errors in velocity estimates arise if the central assumptions of a common splicing rate and the observation of the full splicing dynamics with steady-state mRNA levels are violated. With scVelo (https://scvelo.org), we address these restrictions by solving the full transcriptional dynamics of splicing kinetics using a likelihood-based dynamical model. This generalizes RNA velocity to a wide variety of systems comprising transient cell states, which are common in development and in response to perturbations. We infer gene-specific rates of transcription, splicing and degradation, and recover the latent time of the underlying cellular processes. This latent time represents the cell’s internal clock and is based only on its transcriptional dynamics. Moreover, scVelo allows us to identify regimes of regulatory changes such as stages of cell fate commitment and, therein, systematically detects putative driver genes. We demonstrate that scVelo enables disentangling heterogeneous subpopulation kinetics with unprecedented resolution in hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis and pancreatic endocrinogenesis. We anticipate that scVelo will greatly facilitate the study of lineage decisions, gene regulation, and pathway activity identification.	698	1.9110198494182067	5	46	84	0.12034383954154727	139.8

Here, we developed Cumulus, a cloud-based framework for analyzing large scale sc/snRNA-seq datasets. Cumulus combines the power of cloud computing with improvements in algorithm implementations to achieve high scalability, low cost, user-friendliness, and integrated support for a comprehensive set of features. We benchmark Cumulus on the Human Cell Atlas Census of Immune Cells dataset of bone marrow cells and show that it substantially improves efficiency over conventional frameworks, while maintaining or improving the quality of results, enabling large-scale studies.	697	1.9082819986310746	14	61	8	0.011477761836441894	30.23
10.1101/828483	FALSE	TRUE	Sample demultiplexing, multiplet detection, experiment planning and novel cell type verification in single cell sequencing	2019-11-04	Identifying and removing multiplets from downstream analysis is essential to improve the scalability and reliability of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). High multiplet rates create artificial cell types in the dataset. Sample barcoding, including the cell hashing technology and the MULTI-seq technology, enables analytical identification of a fraction of multiplets in a scRNA-seq dataset.We propose a Gaussian-mixture-model-based multiplet identification method, GMM-Demux. GMM-Demux accurately identifies and removes the sample-barcoding-detectable multiplets and estimates the percentage of sample-barcoding-undetectable multiplets in the remaining dataset. GMM-Demux describes the droplet formation process with an augmented binomial probabilistic model, and uses the model to authenticate cell types discovered from a scRNA-seq dataset.We conducted two cell-hashing experiments, collected a public cell-hashing dataset, and generated a simulated cellhashing dataset. We compared the classification result of GMM-Demux against a state-of-the-art heuristic-based classifier. We show that GMM-Demux is more accurate, more stable, reduces the error rate by up to 69×, and is capable of reliably recognizing 9 multiplet-induced fake cell types and 8 real cell types in a PBMC scRNA-seq dataset.	692	1.894592744695414	9	46	2	0.002890173410404624	18.15

However, those approaches only allow analysis of one extremity of the transcript after short read sequencing.

To improve the power to identify real cells and rare subpopulations, we introduce CB2, a cluster-based approach for distinguishing real cells from background barcodes.	690	1.88911704312115	4	17	0	0	1.75
10.1101/832626	FALSE	TRUE	GeneSwitches : Ordering gene-expression and functional events in single-cell experiments	2019-11-06	Emerging single-cell RNA-seq technologies has made it possible to capture and assess the gene expression of individual cells. Based on the similarity of gene expression profiles, many tools have been developed to generate an in silico ordering of cells in the form of pseudo-time trajectories. However, these tools do not provide a means to find the ordering of critical gene expression changes over pseudo-time. We present GeneSwitches, a tool that takes any single-cell pseudo-time trajectory and determines the precise order of gene-expression and functional-event changes over time. GeneSwitches uses a statistical framework based on logistic regression to identify the order in which genes are either switched on or off along pseudo-time. With this information, users can identify the order in which surface markers appear, investigate how functional ontologies are gained or lost over time, and compare the ordering of switching genes from two related pseudo-temporal processes.GeneSwitches is available at https://geneswitches.ddnetbio.comowen.rackham@duke-nus.edu.sgis available at http://www.ddnetbio.com/files/GeneSwitches_SI.pdf	690	1.88911704312115	3	4	0	0	13.05
10.1101/834549	FALSE	TRUE	Metric learning enables synthesis of heterogeneous single-cell modalities	2019-11-08	A complete understanding of biological processes requires synthesizing information across heterogeneous modalities, such as age, disease status, or gene/protein expression. Until recently, single-cell profiling experiments could measure only a single modality, leading to analysis focused on integrating information across separate experiments. However, researchers can now measure multiple modalities simultaneously in a single experiment, providing a new data paradigm that enables biological discovery but also requires new conceptual and analytic models. We therefore present Schema, an algorithm that leverages a principled metric learning strategy to synthesize multimodal information from the same experiment. To demonstrate the flexibility and power of our approach, we use Schema to infer cell types by integrating gene expression and chromatin accessibility data, perform differential gene expression analysis while accounting for batch effects and developmental age, estimate evolutionary pressure on peptide sequences, and synthesize spliced and unspliced mRNA data to infer cell differentiation. Schema can synthesize arbitrarily many modalities and capture sophisticated relationships between them, is computationally efficient, and provides a valuable conceptual model for exploring and understanding complex biology.	688	1.8836413415468858	4	60	3	0.00436046511627907	5.8
10.1101/836650	FALSE	TRUE	Exploring High-Dimensional Biological Data with Sparse Contrastive Principal Component Analysis	2019-11-09	Statistical analyses of high-throughput sequencing data have re-shaped the biological sciences. In spite of myriad advances, recovering interpretable biological signal from data corrupted by technical noise remains a prevalent open problem. Several classes of procedures, among them classical dimensionality reduction techniques and others incorporating subject-matter knowledge, have provided effective advances; however, no procedure currently satisfies the dual objectives of recovering stable and relevant features simultaneously.Inspired by recent proposals for making use of control data in the removal of unwanted variation, we propose a variant of principal component analysis, sparse contrastive principal component analysis, that extracts sparse, stable, interpretable, and relevant biological signal. The new methodology is compared to competing dimensionality reduction approaches through a simulation study as well as via analyses of several publicly available protein expression, microarray gene expression, and single-cell transcriptome sequencing datasets.A free and open-source software implementation of the methodology, the scPCA R package, is made available via the Bioconductor Project.

10.1101/837104	FALSE	TRUE	MOFA+: a probabilistic framework for comprehensive integration of structured single-cell data	2019-11-09	Technological advances have enabled the joint analysis of multiple molecular layers at single cell resolution. At the same time, increased experimental throughput has facilitated the study of larger numbers of experimental conditions. While methods for analysing single-cell data that model the resulting structure of either of these dimensions are beginning to emerge, current methods do not account for complex experimental designs that include both multiple views (modalities or assays) and groups (conditions or experiments). Here we present Multi-Omics Factor Analysis v2 (MOFA+), a statistical framework for the comprehensive and scalable integration of structured single cell multi-modal data. MOFA+ builds upon a Bayesian Factor Analysis framework combined with fast GPU-accelerated stochastic variational inference. Similar to existing factor models, MOFA+ allows for interpreting variation in single-cell datasets by pooling information across cells and features to reconstruct a low-dimensional representation of the data. Uniquely, the model supports flexible group-level sparsity constraints that allow joint modelling of variation across multiple groups and views.To illustrate MOFA+, we applied it to single-cell data sets of different scales and designs, demonstrating practical advantages when analyzing datasets with complex group and/or view structure. In a multi-omics analysis of mouse gastrulation this joint modelling reveals coordinated changes between gene expression and epigenetic variation associated with cell fate commitment.	687	1.8809034907597535	7	68	11	0.01601164483260553	60

However, current methods often result in two or more cells that share the same cell-identifying barcode; these “doublets” violate the fundamental premise of single cell technology and can lead to incorrect inferences. Here, we describe Solo, a semi-supervised deep learning approach that identifies doublets with greater accuracy than existing methods. Solo can be applied in combination with experimental doublet detection methods to further purify scRNA-seq data to true single cells beyond any previous approach.	682	1.8672142368240932	6	34	1	0.001466275659824047	15.45

Currently however, there is no software to easily and simultaneously analyze both types of data. Here, we introduce Single-Cell Virtual Cytometer, an open-source software for flow cytometry-like visualization and exploration of multi-omics single cell datasets. Using an original CITE-seq dataset of PBMC from an healthy donor, we illustrate its use for the integrated analysis of transcriptomes and phenotypes of functional maturation in peripheral T lymphocytes from healthy donors. So this free and open-source algorithm constitutes a unique resource for biologists seeking for a user-friendly analytic tool for multimodal single cell datasets.	681	1.864476386036961	10	18	0	0	6.8

Many trajectory inference methods have been developed to order cells by their progression through a dynamic process. However, when time series data is available, these methods do not consider the available time information when ordering cells and are instead designed to work only on a single scRNAseq data snapshot. We present Tempora, a novel cell trajectory inference method that orders cells using time information from time-series scRNAseq data. In performance comparison tests, Tempora accurately inferred developmental lineages in human skeletal myoblast differentiation and murine cerebral cortex development, beating state of the art methods. Tempora uses biological pathway information to help identify cell type relationships and can identify important time-dependent pathways to help interpret the inferred trajectory. Our results demonstrate the utility of time information to supervise trajectory inference for scRNA-seq based analysis.	678	1.8562628336755647	2	40	1	0.0014749262536873156	38.68

While dimensionality reduction is a crucial step in interpreting the relation between cells based on scRNA-seq, current methods often are hampered by “crowding” of cells in the center of the latent space, biased by batch effects, or inadequately capture developmental relationships. Here, we introduced scPhere, a scalable deep generative model to embed cells into low-dimensional hyperspherical or hyperbolic spaces, as a more accurate representation of the data. ScPhere resolves cell crowding, corrects multiple, complex batch factors, facilitates interactive visualization of large datasets, and gracefully uncovers pseudotemporal trajectories. We demonstrate scPhere on six large datasets in complex tissue from human patients or animal development, demonstrating how it controls for both technical and biological factors and highlights complex cellular relations and biological insights.	671	1.83709787816564	2	66	9	0.013412816691505217	186.214

Among various single-cell multi-modal strategies, cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) allows simultaneous quantification of two distinct species: RNA and surface marker proteins (ADT). Here, we introduce CiteFuse, a streamlined package consisting of a suite of tools for pre-processing, modality integration, clustering, differential RNA and ADT expression analysis, ADT evaluation, ligand-receptor interaction analysis, and interactive web-based visualization of CITE-seq data. We show the capacity of CiteFuse to integrate the two data modalities and its relative advantage against data generated from single modality profiling. Furthermore, we illustrate the pre-processing steps in CiteFuse and in particular a novel doublet detection method based on a combined index of cell hashing and transcriptome data.

Current packages for identity assignment use limited types of reference data, and often have rigid data structure requirements. As such, a more flexible tool, capable of handling multiple types of reference data and data structures, would be beneficial.To address difficulties in cluster identity assignment, we developed the clustifyr R package. The package leverages external datasets, including gene expression profiles from scRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, microarray expression data, and/or signature gene lists, to assign likely cell types. We benchmark various parameters of a correlation-based approach, and also implement a variety of gene list enrichment methods. By providing tools for exploratory data analysis, we demonstrate the feasibility of a simple and effective data-driven approach for cell type assignment in scRNA-seq cell clusters.clustifyr is a lightweight and effective cell type assignment tool developed for compatibility with various scRNA-seq analysis workflows. clustifyr is publicly available at https://github.com/rnabioco/clustifyr	670	1.834360027378508	8	24	2	0.0029850746268656717	27.45
10.1101/859751	FALSE	TRUE	Alignment of time-course single-cell RNA-seq data with CAPITAL	2019-11-29	Recent techniques on single-cell RNA sequencing have boosted transcriptome-wide observation of gene expression dynamics of time-course data at a single-cell scale. Typical examples of such analysis include inference of a pseudotime cell trajectory, and comparison of pseudotime trajectories between different experimental conditions will tell us how feature genes regulate a dynamic cellular process. Existing methods for comparing pseudotime trajectories, however, force users to select trajectories to be compared because they can deal only with simple linear trajectories, leading to the possibility of making a biased interpretation. Here we present CAPITAL, a method for comparing pseudotime trajectories with tree alignment whereby trajectories including branching can be compared without any knowledge of paths to be compared. Computational tests on time-series public data indicate that CAPITAL can align non-linear pseudotime trajectories and reveal gene expression dynamics.	667	1.8261464750171115	4	20	0	0	10.83

Despite recent success, there is a pressing need for specialized methods tailored towards the functional interpretation of these cellular maps. Here, we present DrivAER, a machine learning approach that scores annotated gene sets based on their relevance to user-specified outcomes such as pseudotemporal ordering or disease status. We demonstrate that DrivAER extracts the key driving pathways and transcription factors that regulate complex biological processes from scRNA-seq data.	661	1.809719370294319	3	34	0	0	9.7
10.1101/864389	FALSE	TRUE	UniPath: A uniform approach for pathway and gene-set based analysis of heterogeneity in single-cell epigenome and transcriptome profiles	2019-12-11	Here, we introduce UniPath, for representing single-cells using pathway and gene-set enrichment scores by a transformation of their open-chromatin or gene-expression profiles. Besides being robust to variability in dropout, UniPath provides consistency and scalability in estimating gene-set enrichment scores for every cell. UniPath’s approach of predicting temporal-order of single-cells using their gene-set activity score enables suppression of known covariates. UniPath based analysis of mouse cell atlas yielded surprising, albeit biologically-meaningful co-clustering of cell-types from distant organs and helped in annotating many unlabeled cells. By enabling unconventional analysis, UniPath also proves to be useful in inferring context-specific regulation in cancer cells.	655	1.7932922655715264	7	59	1	0.0015267175572519084	30.38
10.1101/864488	FALSE	TRUE	WEDGE: recovery of gene expression values for sparse single-cell RNA-seq datasets using matrix decomposition	2019-12-04	The low capture rate of expressed RNAs from single-cell sequencing technology is one of the major obstacles to downstream functional genomics analyses. Recently, a number of imputation methods have emerged for single-cell transcriptome data, however, recovering missing values in very sparse expression matrices remains a substantial challenge. Here, we propose a new algorithm, WEDGE (WEighted Decomposition of Gene Expression), to impute gene expression matrices by using a biased low-rank matrix decomposition method (bLRMD). WEDGE successfully recovered expression matrices, reproduced the cell-wise and gene-wise correlations, and improved the clustering of cells, performing impressively for applications with multiple cell type datasets with high dropout rates. Overall, this study demonstrates a potent approach for imputing sparse expression matrix data, and our WEDGE algorithm should help many researchers to more profitably explore the biological meanings embedded in their scRNA-seq datasets.	662	1.8124572210814511	7	44	0	0	9.58
10.1101/867309	FALSE	TRUE	Sierra: Discovery of differential transcript usage from polyA-captured single-cell RNA-seq data	2019-12-06	High-throughput single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for studying gene expression in single cells. Most current scRNA-seq bioinformatics tools focus on analysing overall expression levels, largely ignoring alternative mRNA isoform expression. We present a computational pipeline, Sierra, that readily detects differential transcript usage from data generated by commonly used polyA-captured scRNA-seq technology. We validate Sierra by comparing cardiac scRNA-seq cell-types to bulk RNA-seq of matched populations, finding significant overlap in differential transcripts. Sierra detects differential transcript usage across human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the Tabula Muris, and 3’UTR shortening in cardiac fibroblasts.

Here, we present scNym, a semisupervised, adversarial neural network that learns to transfer cell identity annotations from one experiment to another. scNym takes advantage of information in both labeled data sets and new, unlabeled data sets to learn rich representations of cell identity that enable effective annotation transfer. We show that scNym effectively transfers annotations across experiments despite biological and technical differences, achieving performance superior to existing methods. We also show that scNym models can synthesize information from multiple training and target data sets to improve performance. We show that in addition to high accuracy, scNym models are well calibrated and interpretable with saliency methods.	214	0.5859000684462696	2	0	3	0.014018691588785047	NA
10.1101/gr.268722.120	FALSE	FALSE	Bayesian estimation of cell type-specific gene expression with prior derived from single-cell data	2021-04-09	When assessed over a large number of samples, bulk RNA sequencing provides reliable data for gene expression at the tissue level. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) deepens those analyses by evaluating gene expression at the cellular level. Both data types lend insights into disease etiology. With current technologies, scRNA-seq data are known to be noisy. Constrained by costs, scRNA-seq data are typically generated from a relatively small number of subjects, which limits their utility for some analyses, such as identification of gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). To address these issues while maintaining the unique advantages of each data type, we develop a Bayesian method (bMIND) to integrate bulk and scRNA-seq data. With a prior derived from scRNA-seq data, we propose to estimate sample-level cell type–specific (CTS) expression from bulk expression data. The CTS expression enables large-scale sample-level downstream analyses, such as detection of CTS differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and eQTLs. Through simulations, we show that bMIND improves the accuracy of sample-level CTS expression estimates and increases the power to discover CTS DEGs when compared to existing methods. To further our understanding of two complex phenotypes, autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease, we apply bMIND to gene expression data of relevant brain tissue to identify CTS DEGs. Our results complement findings for CTS DEGs obtained from snRNA-seq studies, replicating certain DEGs in specific cell types while nominating other novel genes for those cell types. Finally, we calculate CTS eQTLs for 11 brain regions by analyzing Genotype-Tissue Expression Project data, creating a new resource for biological insights.	170	0.4654346338124572	3	0	3	0.01764705882352941	1.75
10.1101/gr.271205.120	FALSE	FALSE	A graph neural network model to estimate cell-wise metabolic flux using single-cell RNA-seq data	2021-07-22	The metabolic heterogeneity and metabolic interplay between cells are known as significant contributors to disease treatment resistance. However, with the lack of a mature high-throughput single-cell metabolomics technology, we are yet to establish systematic understanding of the intra-tissue metabolic heterogeneity and cooperative mechanisms. To mitigate this knowledge gap, we developed a novel computational method, namely, single-cell flux estimation analysis (scFEA), to infer the cell-wise fluxome from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. scFEA is empowered by a systematically reconstructed human metabolic map as a factor graph, a novel probabilistic model to leverage the flux balance constraints on scRNA-seq data, and a novel graph neural network–based optimization solver. The intricate information cascade from transcriptome to metabolome was captured using multilayer neural networks to capitulate the nonlinear dependency between enzymatic gene expressions and reaction rates. We experimentally validated scFEA by generating an scRNA-seq data set with matched metabolomics data on cells of perturbed oxygen and genetic conditions. Application of scFEA on this data set showed the consistency between predicted flux and the observed variation of metabolite abundance in the matched metabolomics data. We also applied scFEA on five publicly available scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data sets and identified context- and cell group–specific metabolic variations. The cell-wise fluxome predicted by scFEA empowers a series of downstream analyses including identification of metabolic modules or cell groups that share common metabolic variations, sensitivity evaluation of enzymes with regards to their impact on the whole metabolic flux, and inference of cell–tissue and cell–cell metabolic communications.	66	0.1806981519507187	13	0	0	0	9.5
10.1101/gr.271346.120	FALSE	FALSE	Analysis of alternative polyadenylation from single-cell RNA-seq using scDaPars reveals cell subpopulations invisible to gene expression	2021-05-25	Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a major mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation in various cellular processes including cell proliferation and differentiation, but the APA heterogeneity among single cells remains largely unknown. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been extensively used to define cell subpopulations at the transcription level. Yet, most scRNA-seq data have not been analyzed in an “APA-aware” manner. Here, we introduce dynamic analysis of APA from single-cell RNA-seq (scDaPars), a bioinformatics algorithm to accurately quantify APA events at both single-cell and single-gene resolution using either 3′-end (10x Chromium) or full-length (Smart-seq2) scRNA-seq data. Validations in both real and simulated data indicate that scDaPars can robustly recover missing APA events caused by the low amounts of mRNA sequenced in single cells. When applied to cancer and human endoderm differentiation data, scDaPars not only revealed cell-type-specific APA regulation but also identified cell subpopulations that are otherwise invisible to conventional gene expression analysis. Thus, scDaPars will enable us to understand cellular heterogeneity at the post-transcriptional APA level.	124	0.3394934976043806	4	0	3	0.024193548387096774	17.5
10.1101/gr.271874.120	FALSE	FALSE	A joint deep learning model enables simultaneous batch effect correction, denoising and clustering in single-cell transcriptomics	2021-05-25	Recent developments of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technologies have led to enormous biological discoveries. As the scale of scRNA-seq studies increases, a major challenge in analysis is batch effects, which are inevitable in studies involving human tissues. Most existing methods remove batch effects in a low-dimensional embedding space. Although useful for clustering, batch effects are still present in the gene expression space, leaving downstream gene-level analysis susceptible to batch effects. Recent studies have shown that batch effect correction in the gene expression space is much harder than in the embedding space. Methods such as Seurat 3.0 rely on the mutual nearest neighbor (MNN) approach to remove batch effects in gene expression, but MNN can only analyze two batches at a time, and it becomes computationally infeasible when the number of batches is large. Here, we present CarDEC, a joint deep learning model that simultaneously clusters and denoises scRNA-seq data while correcting batch effects both in the embedding and the gene expression space. Comprehensive evaluations spanning different species and tissues showed that CarDEC outperforms Scanorama, DCA + Combat, scVI, and MNN. With CarDEC denoising, non-highly variable genes offer as much signal for clustering as the highly variable genes (HVGs), suggesting that CarDEC substantially boosted information content in scRNA-seq. We also showed that trajectory analysis using CarDEC's denoised and batch-corrected expression as input revealed marker genes and transcription factors that are otherwise obscured in the presence of batch effects. CarDEC is computationally fast, making it a desirable tool for large-scale scRNA-seq studies.	124	0.3394934976043806	10	0	0	0	1.25
10.1101/gr.271908.120	FALSE	FALSE	Automated quality control and cell identification of droplet-based single-cell data using dropkick	2021-04-09	A major challenge for droplet-based single-cell sequencing technologies is distinguishing true cells from uninformative barcodes in data sets with disparate library sizes confounded by high technical noise (i.e., batch-specific ambient RNA). We present dropkick, a fully automated software tool for quality control and filtering of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data with a focus on excluding ambient barcodes and recovering real cells bordering the quality threshold. By automatically determining data set–specific training labels based on predictive global heuristics, dropkick learns a gene-based representation of real cells and ambient noise, calculating a cell probability score for each barcode. Using simulated and real-world scRNA-seq data, we benchmarked dropkick against conventional thresholding approaches and EmptyDrops, a popular computational method, showing greater recovery of rare cell types and exclusion of empty droplets and noisy, uninformative barcodes. We show for both low- and high-background data sets that dropkick's weakly supervised model reliably learns which genes are enriched in ambient barcodes and draws a multidimensional boundary that is more robust to data set–specific variation than existing filtering approaches. dropkick provides a fast, automated tool for reproducible cell identification from scRNA-seq data that is critical to downstream analysis and compatible with popular single-cell Python packages.	170	0.4654346338124572	5	0	0	0	16.4
10.1101/gr.272344.120	FALSE	FALSE	A likelihood-based deconvolution of bulk gene expression data using single-cell references	2021-07-22	Direct comparison of bulk gene expression profiles is complicated by distinct cell type mixtures in each sample that obscure whether observed differences are actually caused by changes in the expression levels themselves or are simply a result of differing cell type compositions. Single-cell technology has made it possible to measure gene expression in individual cells, achieving higher resolution at the expense of increased noise. If carefully incorporated, such single-cell data can be used to deconvolve bulk samples to yield accurate estimates of the true cell type proportions, thus enabling one to disentangle the effects of differential expression and cell type mixtures. Here, we propose a generative model and a likelihood-based inference method that uses asymptotic statistical theory and a novel optimization procedure to perform deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data to produce accurate cell type proportion estimates. We show the effectiveness of our method, called RNA-Sieve, across a diverse array of scenarios involving real data and discuss extensions made uniquely possible by our probabilistic framework, including a demonstration of well-calibrated confidence intervals.	66	0.1806981519507187	4	0	0	0	1

We describe CytoTalk for de novo construction of cell type–specific signaling networks using single-cell transcriptomic data. Using an integrated intracellular and intercellular gene network as the input, CytoTalk identifies candidate pathways using the prize-collecting Steiner forest algorithm. Using high-throughput spatial transcriptomic data and single-cell RNA sequencing data with receptor gene perturbation, we demonstrate that CytoTalk has substantial improvement over existing algorithms. To better understand plasticity of signaling networks across tissues and developmental stages, we perform a comparative analysis of signaling networks between macrophages and endothelial cells across human adult and fetal tissues. Our analysis reveals an overall increased plasticity of signaling networks across adult tissues and specific network nodes that contribute to increased plasticity. CytoTalk enables de novo construction of signal transduction pathways and facilitates comparative analysis of these pathways across tissues and conditions.	165	0.4517453798767967	4	68	3	0.01818181818181818	28.95

To uncover these transcriptional trajectories during zebrafish embryogenesis, we sequenced 38,731 cells and developed URD, a simulated diffusion-based computational reconstruction method. URD identified the trajectories of 25 cell types through early somitogenesis, gene expression along them, and their spatial origin in the blastula. Analysis of Nodal signaling mutants revealed that their transcriptomes were canalized into a subset of wild-type transcriptional trajectories. Some wild-type developmental branch points contained cells that express genes characteristic of multiple fates. These cells appeared to trans-specify from one fate to another. These findings reconstruct the transcriptional trajectories of a vertebrate embryo, highlight the concurrent canalization and plasticity of embryonic specification, and provide a framework with which to reconstruct complex developmental trees from single-cell transcriptomes.	1249	3.4195756331279945	6	51	329	0.2634107285828663	385.684

Using these annotations, we find that (i) the correlation between a cell’s lineage and its transcriptome increases from middle to late gastrulation, then falls substantially as cells in the nervous system and pharynx adopt their terminal fates; (ii) multilineage priming contributes to the differentiation of sister cells at dozens of lineage branches; and (iii) most distinct lineages that produce the same anatomical cell type converge to a homogenous transcriptomic state.	752	2.0588637919233403	12	66	120	0.1595744680851064	143.73

10.1142/s0219720020400090	FALSE	FALSE	ClusterMine: A knowledge-integrated clustering approach based on expression profiles of gene sets	2020-07-07	Clustering analysis of gene expression data is essential for understanding complex biological data, and is widely used in important biological applications such as the identification of cell subpopulations and disease subtypes. In commonly used methods such as hierarchical clustering (HC) and consensus clustering (CC), holistic expression profiles of all genes are often used to assess the similarity between samples for clustering. While these methods have been proven successful in identifying sample clusters in many areas, they do not provide information about which gene sets (functions) contribute most to the clustering, thus limiting the interpretability of the resulting cluster. We hypothesize that integrating prior knowledge of annotated gene sets would not only achieve satisfactory clustering performance but also, more importantly, enable potential biological interpretation of clusters. Here we report ClusterMine, an approach that identifies clusters by assessing functional similarity between samples through integrating known annotated gene sets in functional annotation databases such as Gene Ontology. In addition to the cluster membership of each sample as provided by conventional approaches, it also outputs gene sets that most likely contribute to the clustering, thus facilitating biological interpretation. We compare ClusterMine with conventional approaches on nine real-world experimental datasets that represent different application scenarios in biology. We find that ClusterMine achieves better performances and that the gene sets prioritized by our method are biologically meaningful.

An essential task in scRNA-seq data analysis is the identification of cell types from complex samples or tissues profiled in an experiment. To this end, clustering has become a key computational technique for grouping cells based on their transcriptome profiles, enabling subsequent cell type identification from each cluster of cells. Due to the high feature-dimensionality of the transcriptome (i.e. the large number of measured genes in each cell) and because only a small fraction of genes are cell type-specific and therefore informative for generating cell type-specific clusters, clustering directly on the original feature/gene dimension may lead to uninformative clusters and hinder correct cell type identification. Here, we propose an autoencoder-based cluster ensemble framework in which we first take random subspace projections from the data, then compress each random projection to a low-dimensional space using an autoencoder artificial neural network, and finally apply ensemble clustering across all encoded datasets to generate clusters of cells. We employ four evaluation metrics to benchmark clustering performance and our experiments demonstrate that the proposed autoencoder-based cluster ensemble can lead to substantially improved cell type-specific clusters when applied with both the standard k-means clustering algorithm and a state-of-the-art kernel-based clustering algorithm (SIMLR) designed specifically for scRNA-seq data. Compared to directly using these clustering algorithms on the original datasets, the performance improvement in some cases is up to 100%, depending on the evaluation metric used. Our results suggest that the proposed framework can facilitate more accurate cell type identification as well as other downstream analyses. The code for creating the proposed autoencoder-based cluster ensemble framework is freely available from https://github.com/gedcom/scCCESS	642	1.757700205338809	7	40	12	0.018691588785046728	10.696
10.1186/s12859-019-3211-9	FALSE	FALSE	scDC: single cell differential composition analysis	2019-12-24	Differences in cell-type composition across subjects and conditions often carry biological significance. Recent advancements in single cell sequencing technologies enable cell-types to be identified at the single cell level, and as a result, cell-type composition of tissues can now be studied in exquisite detail. However, a number of challenges remain with cell-type composition analysis – none of the existing methods can identify cell-type perfectly and variability related to cell sampling exists in any single cell experiment. This necessitates the development of method for estimating uncertainty in cell-type composition. We developed a novel single cell differential composition (scDC) analysis method that performs differential cell-type composition analysis via bootstrap resampling. scDC captures the uncertainty associated with cell-type proportions of each subject via bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals. We assessed the performance of our method using a number of simulated datasets and synthetic datasets curated from publicly available single cell datasets. In simulated datasets, scDC correctly recovered the true cell-type proportions. In synthetic datasets, the cell-type compositions returned by scDC were highly concordant with reference cell-type compositions from the original data. Since the majority of datasets tested in this study have only 2 to 5 subjects per condition, the addition of confidence intervals enabled better comparisons of compositional differences between subjects and across conditions. scDC is a novel statistical method for performing differential cell-type composition analysis for scRNA-seq data. It uses bootstrap resampling to estimate the standard errors associated with cell-type proportion estimates and performs significance testing through GLM and GLMM models. We have made this method available to the scientific community as part of the scdney package (Single Cell Data Integrative Analysis) R package, available from https://github.com/SydneyBioX/scdney.	642	1.757700205338809	6	25	9	0.014018691588785047	0.75

However, for expression data generated by different experimental design and platforms, there is currently lack of capability to determine the most proper statistical model. We developed an R package, namely Multi-Modal Model Selection (M3S), for gene-wise selection of the most proper multi-modality statistical model and downstream analysis, useful in a single-cell or large scale bulk tissue transcriptomic data. M3S is featured with (1) gene-wise selection of the most parsimonious model among 11 most commonly utilized ones, that can best fit the expression distribution of the gene, (2) parameter estimation of a selected model, and (3) differential gene expression test based on the selected model. A comprehensive evaluation suggested that M3S can accurately capture the multimodality on simulated and real single cell data.

Due to the low amounts of transcripts in single cells and the technical biases in experiments, the raw scRNA-seq data usually includes large noise and makes the downstream analyses complicated. Although many methods have been proposed to impute the noisy scRNA-seq data in recent years, few of them take into account the prior associations across genes in imputation and integrate multiple types of imputation data to identify cell types. We present a new framework, NetImpute, towards the identification of cell types from scRNA-seq data by integrating multiple types of biological networks. We employ a statistic method to detect the noise data items in scRNA-seq data and develop a new imputation model to estimate the real values of data noise by integrating the PPI network and gene pathways. Meanwhile, based on the data imputed by multiple types of biological networks, we propose an integrated approach to identify cell types from scRNA-seq data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network-based imputation model can estimate the real values of noise data items accurately and integrating the imputation data based on multiple types of biological networks can improve the identification of cell types from scRNA-seq data. Incorporating the prior gene associations in biological networks can potentially help to improve the imputation of noisy scRNA-seq data and integrating multiple types of network-based imputation data can enhance the identification of cell types. The proposed NetImpute provides an open framework for incorporating multiple types of biological network data to identify cell types from scRNA-seq data.	472	1.2922655715263518	4	54	0	0	8.83
10.1186/s12859-020-03561-y	FALSE	FALSE	OscoNet: inferring oscillatory gene networks	2020-08-25	Oscillatory genes, with periodic expression at the mRNA and/or protein level, have been shown to play a pivotal role in many biological contexts. However, with the exception of the circadian clock and cell cycle, only a few such genes are known. Detecting oscillatory genes from snapshot single-cell experiments is a challenging task due to the lack of time information. Oscope is a recently proposed method to identify co-oscillatory gene pairs using single-cell RNA-seq data. Although promising, the current implementation of Oscope does not provide a principled statistical criterion for selecting oscillatory genes. We improve the optimisation scheme underlying Oscope and provide a well-calibrated non-parametric hypothesis test to select oscillatory genes at a given FDR threshold. We evaluate performance on synthetic data and three real datasets and show that our approach is more sensitive than the original Oscope formulation, discovering larger sets of known oscillators while avoiding the need for less interpretable thresholds. We also describe how our proposed pseudo-time estimation method is more accurate in recovering the true cell order for each gene cluster while requiring substantially less computation time than the extended nearest insertion approach. OscoNet is a robust and versatile approach to detect oscillatory gene networks from snapshot single-cell data addressing many of the limitations of the original Oscope method.	397	1.0869267624914443	5	21	1	0.0025188916876574307	7.5

Determining small sets of genetic markers that can identify specific cell populations is thus one of the major objectives of computational analysis of mRNA counts data. Many tools have been developed for marker selection on single cell data; most of them, however, are based on complex statistical models and handle the multi-class case in an ad-hoc manner. We introduce RankCorr, a fast method with strong mathematical underpinnings that performs multi-class marker selection in an informed manner. RankCorr proceeds by ranking the mRNA counts data before linearly separating the ranked data using a small number of genes. The step of ranking is intuitively natural for scRNA-seq data and provides a non-parametric method for analyzing count data. In addition, we present several performance measures for evaluating the quality of a set of markers when there is no known ground truth. Using these metrics, we compare the performance of RankCorr to a variety of other marker selection methods on an assortment of experimental and synthetic data sets that range in size from several thousand to one million cells. According to the metrics introduced in this work, RankCorr is consistently one of most optimal marker selection methods on scRNA-seq data. Most methods show similar overall performance, however; thus, the speed of the algorithm is the most important consideration for large data sets (and comparing the markers selected by several methods can be fruitful). RankCorr is fast enough to easily handle the largest data sets and, as such, it is a useful tool to add into computational pipelines when dealing with high throughput scRNA-seq data.

Cell typing is one of the key challenges in scRNA-seq data analysis that is usually achieved by estimating the expression of cell marker genes. However, there is no standard practice for cell typing, often resulting in variable and inaccurate outcomes. We have developed a comprehensive and user-friendly R-based scRNA-seq analysis and cell typing package, scTyper. scTyper also provides a database of cell type markers, scTyper.db, which contains 213 cell marker sets collected from literature. These marker sets include but are not limited to markers for malignant cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and tumor-infiltrating T cells. Additionally, scTyper provides three customized methods for estimating cell-type marker expression, including nearest template prediction (NTP), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and average expression values. DNA copy number inference method (inferCNV) has been implemented with an improved modification that can be used for malignant cell typing. The package also supports the data preprocessing pipelines by Cell Ranger from 10X Genomics and the Seurat package. A summary reporting system is also implemented, which may facilitate users to perform reproducible analyses. scTyper provides a comprehensive and user-friendly analysis pipeline for cell typing of scRNA-seq data with a curated cell marker database, scTyper.db.	418	1.1444216290212184	3	18	3	0.007177033492822967	17.426

With the advancement of new technologies, such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), there is a need for developing novel network methods appropriate for new types of data. We present a novel sparse Bayesian factor model to explore the network structure associated with genes in scRNA-seq data. Latent factors impact the gene expression values for each cell and provide flexibility to account for common features of scRNA-seq: high proportions of zero values, increased cell-to-cell variability, and overdispersion due to abnormally large expression counts. From our model, we construct a GCN by analyzing the positive and negative associations of the factors that are shared between each pair of genes. Simulation studies demonstrate that our methodology has high power in identifying gene-gene associations while maintaining a nominal false discovery rate. In real data analyses, our model identifies more known and predicted protein-protein interactions than other competing network models.	404	1.106091718001369	3	34	3	0.007425742574257425	10.596

It’s already widely used for exploring the dynamic development process of life, studying the gene regulation mechanism, and discovering new cell types. However, the low RNA capture rate, which cause highly sparse expression with dropout, makes it difficult to do downstream analyses. We propose a new method SCC to impute the dropouts of scRNA-seq data. Experiment results show that SCC gives competitive results compared to two existing methods while showing superiority in reducing the intra-class distance of cells and improving the clustering accuracy in both simulation and real data.

Dimensionality reduction is an essential first step in downstream analysis of the scRNA-seq data. However, the scRNA-seq data are challenging for traditional methods due to their high dimensional measurements as well as an abundance of dropout events (that is, zero expression measurements). To overcome these difficulties, we propose DR-A (Dimensionality Reduction with Adversarial variational autoencoder), a data-driven approach to fulfill the task of dimensionality reduction. DR-A leverages a novel adversarial variational autoencoder-based framework, a variant of generative adversarial networks. DR-A is well-suited for unsupervised learning tasks for the scRNA-seq data, where labels for cell types are costly and often impossible to acquire. Compared with existing methods, DR-A is able to provide a more accurate low dimensional representation of the scRNA-seq data. We illustrate this by utilizing DR-A for clustering of scRNA-seq data. Our results indicate that DR-A significantly enhances clustering performance over state-of-the-art methods.	583	1.596167008898015	3	33	11	0.018867924528301886	20.776

The usual technique is to compare methods on data simulated according to some theoretical model. However, as real data often exhibit violations from theoretical models, this can result in unsubstantiated claims of a method’s performance. Rather than generate data from a theoretical model, in this paper we develop methods to add signal to real RNA-seq datasets. Since the resulting simulated data are not generated from an unrealistic theoretical model, they exhibit realistic (annoying) attributes of real data. This lets RNA-seq methods developers assess their procedures in non-ideal (model-violating) scenarios. Our procedures may be applied to both single-cell and bulk RNA-seq. We show that our simulation method results in more realistic datasets and can alter the conclusions of a differential expression analysis study. We also demonstrate our approach by comparing various factor analysis techniques on RNA-seq datasets. Using data simulated from a theoretical model can substantially impact the results of a study.

The current solutions for annotating single cell clusters generally lack a graphical user interface, can be computationally intensive or have a limited scope. On the other hand, manually annotating single cell clusters by examining the expression of marker genes can be subjective and labor-intensive. To improve the quality and efficiency of annotating cell clusters in scRNAseq data, we present a web-based R/Shiny app and R package, Cluster Identity PRedictor (CIPR), which provides a graphical user interface to quickly score gene expression profiles of unknown cell clusters against mouse or human references, or a custom dataset provided by the user. CIPR can be easily integrated into the current pipelines to facilitate scRNAseq data analysis. CIPR employs multiple approaches for calculating the identity score at the cluster level and can accept inputs generated by popular scRNAseq analysis software. CIPR provides 2 mouse and 5 human reference datasets, and its pipeline allows inter-species comparisons and the ability to upload a custom reference dataset for specialized studies. The option to filter out lowly variable genes and to exclude irrelevant reference cell subsets from the analysis can improve the discriminatory power of CIPR suggesting that it can be tailored to different experimental contexts. Benchmarking CIPR against existing functionally similar software revealed that our algorithm is less computationally demanding, it performs significantly faster and provides accurate predictions for multiple cell clusters in a scRNAseq experiment involving tumor-infiltrating immune cells. CIPR facilitates scRNAseq data analysis by annotating unknown cell clusters in an objective and efficient manner. Platform independence owing to Shiny framework and the requirement for a minimal programming experience allows this software to be used by researchers from different backgrounds. CIPR can accurately predict the identity of a variety of cell clusters and can be used in various experimental contexts across a broad spectrum of research areas.	499	1.3661875427789185	4	32	11	0.022044088176352707	14.93
10.1186/s12859-021-03957-4	FALSE	FALSE	Selecting single cell clustering parameter values using subsampling-based robustness metrics	2021-02-01	Generating and analysing single-cell data has become a widespread approach to examine tissue heterogeneity, and numerous algorithms exist for clustering these datasets to identify putative cell types with shared transcriptomic signatures. However, many of these clustering workflows rely on user-tuned parameter values, tailored to each dataset, to identify a set of biologically relevant clusters. Whereas users often develop their own intuition as to the optimal range of parameters for clustering on each data set, the lack of systematic approaches to identify this range can be daunting to new users of any given workflow. In addition, an optimal parameter set does not guarantee that all clusters are equally well-resolved, given the heterogeneity in transcriptomic signatures in most biological systems. Here, we illustrate a subsampling-based approach (chooseR) that simultaneously guides parameter selection and characterizes cluster robustness. Through bootstrapped iterative clustering across a range of parameters, chooseR was used to select parameter values for two distinct clustering workflows (Seurat and scVI). In each case, chooseR identified parameters that produced biologically relevant clusters from both well-characterized (human PBMC) and complex (mouse spinal cord) datasets. Moreover, it provided a simple “robustness score” for each of these clusters, facilitating the assessment of cluster quality. chooseR is a simple, conceptually understandable tool that can be used flexibly across clustering algorithms, workflows, and datasets to guide clustering parameter selection and characterize cluster robustness.	237	0.648870636550308	3	19	1	0.004219409282700422	4.1
10.1186/s12859-021-04028-4	FALSE	FALSE	scConsensus: combining supervised and unsupervised clustering for cell type identification in single-cell RNA sequencing data	2021-04-12	Clustering is a crucial step in the analysis of single-cell data. Clusters identified in an unsupervised manner are typically annotated to cell types based on differentially expressed genes. In contrast, supervised methods use a reference panel of labelled transcriptomes to guide both clustering and cell type identification. Supervised and unsupervised clustering approaches have their distinct advantages and limitations. Therefore, they can lead to different but often complementary clustering results. Hence, a consensus approach leveraging the merits of both clustering paradigms could result in a more accurate clustering and a more precise cell type annotation. We present scConsensus, an $${\mathbf {R}}$$ R framework for generating a consensus clustering by (1) integrating results from both unsupervised and supervised approaches and (2) refining the consensus clusters using differentially expressed genes. The value of our approach is demonstrated on several existing single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, including data from sorted PBMC sub-populations. scConsensus combines the merits of unsupervised and supervised approaches to partition cells with better cluster separation and homogeneity, thereby increasing our confidence in detecting distinct cell types. scConsensus is implemented in $${\mathbf {R}}$$ R and is freely available on GitHub at https://github.com/prabhakarlab/scConsensus.	167	0.45722108145106094	8	23	1	0.005988023952095809	13.85
10.1186/s12859-021-04136-1	FALSE	FALSE	scSensitiveGeneDefine: sensitive gene detection in single-cell RNA sequencing data by Shannon entropy	2021-04-22	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used technique to obtain gene expression profiles from complex tissues. Cell subsets and developmental states are often identified via differential gene expression patterns. Most of the single-cell tools utilized highly variable genes to annotate cell subsets and states. However, we have discovered that a group of genes, which sensitively respond to environmental stimuli with high coefficients of variation (CV), might impose overwhelming influences on the cell type annotation. In this research, we developed a method, based on the CV-rank and Shannon entropy, to identify these noise genes, and termed them as “sensitive genes”. To validate the reliability of our methods, we applied our tools in 11 single-cell data sets from different human tissues. The results showed that most of the sensitive genes were enriched pathways related to cellular stress response. Furthermore, we noticed that the unsupervised result was closer to the ground-truth cell labels, after removing the sensitive genes detected by our tools. Our study revealed the prevalence of stochastic gene expression patterns in most types of cells, compared the differences among cell marker genes, housekeeping genes (HK genes), and sensitive genes, demonstrated the similarities of functions of sensitive genes in various scRNA-seq data sets, and improved the results of unsupervised clustering towards the ground-truth labels. We hope our method would provide new insights into the reduction of data noise in scRNA-seq data analysis and contribute to the development of better scRNA-seq unsupervised clustering algorithms in the future.	157	0.42984257357973993	5	33	0	0	9.58
10.1186/s12859-021-04150-3	FALSE	FALSE	Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data based on autoencoders	2021-06-08	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) experiments are gaining ground to study the molecular processes that drive normal development as well as the onset of different pathologies. Finding an effective and efficient low-dimensional representation of the data is one of the most important steps in the downstream analysis of scRNA-Seq data, as it could provide a better identification of known or putatively novel cell-types. Another step that still poses a challenge is the integration of different scRNA-Seq datasets. Though standard computational pipelines to gain knowledge from scRNA-Seq data exist, a further improvement could be achieved by means of machine learning approaches. Autoencoders (AEs) have been effectively used to capture the non-linearities among gene interactions of scRNA-Seq data, so that the deployment of AE-based tools might represent the way forward in this context. We introduce here scAEspy, a unifying tool that embodies: (1) four of the most advanced AEs, (2) two novel AEs that we developed on purpose, (3) different loss functions. We show that scAEspy can be coupled with various batch-effect removal tools to integrate data by different scRNA-Seq platforms, in order to better identify the cell-types. We benchmarked scAEspy against the most used batch-effect removal tools, showing that our AE-based strategies outperform the existing solutions. scAEspy is a user-friendly tool that enables using the most recent and promising AEs to analyse scRNA-Seq data by only setting up two user-defined parameters. Thanks to its modularity, scAEspy can be easily extended to accommodate new AEs to further improve the downstream analysis of scRNA-Seq data. Considering the relevant results we achieved, scAEspy can be considered as a starting point to build a more comprehensive toolkit designed to integrate multi single-cell omics.	110	0.30116358658453113	5	80	0	0	9.83
10.1186/s12859-021-04165-w	FALSE	FALSE	SSBER: removing batch effect for single-cell RNA sequencing data	2021-05-14	With the continuous maturity of sequencing technology, different laboratories or different sequencing platforms have generated a large amount of single-cell transcriptome sequencing data for the same or different tissues. Due to batch effects and high dimensions of scRNA data, downstream analysis often faces challenges. Although a number of algorithms and tools have been proposed for removing batch effects, the current mainstream algorithms have faced the problem of data overcorrection when the cell type composition varies greatly between batches. In this paper, we propose a novel method named SSBER by utilizing biological prior knowledge to guide the correction, aiming to solve the problem of poor batch-effect correction when the cell type composition differs greatly between batches. SSBER effectively solves the above problems and outperforms other algorithms when the cell type structure among batches or distribution of cell population varies considerably, or some similar cell types exist across batches.	135	0.36960985626283366	2	32	0	0	15.18
10.1186/s12859-021-04278-2	FALSE	FALSE	Single-cell classification using graph convolutional networks	2021-07-08	Analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data plays an important role in understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic cellular processes in biological and biomedical research. One significant effort in this area is the identification of cell types. With the availability of a huge amount of single cell sequencing data and discovering more and more cell types, classifying cells into known cell types has become a priority nowadays. Several methods have been introduced to classify cells utilizing gene expression data. However, incorporating biological gene interaction networks has been proved valuable in cell classification procedures. In this study, we propose a multimodal end-to-end deep learning model, named sigGCN, for cell classification that combines a graph convolutional network (GCN) and a neural network to exploit gene interaction networks. We used standard classification metrics to evaluate the performance of the proposed method on the within-dataset classification and the cross-dataset classification. We compared the performance of the proposed method with those of the existing cell classification tools and traditional machine learning classification methods. Results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other commonly used methods in terms of classification accuracy and F1 scores. This study shows that the integration of prior knowledge about gene interactions with gene expressions using GCN methodologies can extract effective features improving the performance of cell classification.	80	0.2190280629705681	3	32	0	0	5.2
10.1186/s12859-021-04288-0	FALSE	FALSE	MUREN: a robust and multi-reference approach of RNA-seq transcript normalization	2021-07-28	Normalization of RNA-seq data aims at identifying biological expression differentiation between samples by removing the effects of unwanted confounding factors. Explicitly or implicitly, the justification of normalization requires a set of housekeeping genes. However, the existence of housekeeping genes common for a very large collection of samples, especially under a wide range of conditions, is questionable. We propose to carry out pairwise normalization with respect to multiple references, selected from representative samples. Then the pairwise intermediates are integrated based on a linear model that adjusts the reference effects. Motivated by the notion of housekeeping genes and their statistical counterparts, we adopt the robust least trimmed squares regression in pairwise normalization. The proposed method (MUREN) is compared with other existing tools on some standard data sets. The goodness of normalization emphasizes on preserving possible asymmetric differentiation, whose biological significance is exemplified by a single cell data of cell cycle. MUREN is implemented as an R package. The code under license GPL-3 is available on the github platform: github.com/hippo-yf/MUREN and on the conda platform: anaconda.org/hippo-yf/r-muren. MUREN performs the RNA-seq normalization using a two-step statistical regression induced from a general principle. We propose that the densities of pairwise differentiations are used to evaluate the goodness of normalization. MUREN adjusts the mode of differentiation toward zero while preserving the skewness due to biological asymmetric differentiation. Moreover, by robustly integrating pre-normalized counts with respect to multiple references, MUREN is immune to individual outlier samples.	60	0.16427104722792607	2	42	0	0	2.5

Cell type identification from scRNA-seq data is a critical task in a variety of research such as developmental biology, cell reprogramming, and cancers. Typically, cell type identification relies on human inspection using a combination of prior biological knowledge (e.g. marker genes and morphology) and computational techniques (e.g. PCA and clustering). Due to the incompleteness of our current knowledge and the subjectivity involved in this process, a small amount of cells may be subject to mislabelling. Here, we propose a semi-supervised learning framework, named scReClassify, for ‘post hoc’ cell type identification from scRNA-seq datasets. Starting from an initial cell type annotation with potentially mislabelled cells, scReClassify first performs dimension reduction using PCA and next applies a semi-supervised learning method to learn and subsequently reclassify cells that are likely mislabelled initially to the most probable cell types. By using both simulated and real-world experimental datasets that profiled various tissues and biological systems, we demonstrate that scReClassify is able to accurately identify and reclassify misclassified cells to their correct cell types. scReClassify can be used for scRNA-seq data as a post hoc cell type classification tool to fine-tune cell type annotations generated by any cell type classification procedure.

10.1186/s12864-019-6341-6	FALSE	FALSE	Cloud accelerated alignment and assembly of full-length single-cell RNA-seq data using Falco	2019-12-30	Read alignment and transcript assembly are the core of RNA-seq analysis for transcript isoform discovery. Nonetheless, current tools are not designed to be scalable for analysis of full-length bulk or single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. The previous version of our cloud-based tool Falco only focuses on RNA-seq read counting, but does not allow for more flexible steps such as alignment and read assembly. The Falco framework can harness the parallel and distributed computing environment in modern cloud platforms to accelerate read alignment and transcript assembly of full-length bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data. There are two new modes in Falco: alignment-only and transcript assembly. In the alignment-only mode, Falco can speed up the alignment process by 2.5–16.4x based on two public scRNA-seq datasets when compared to alignment on a highly optimised standalone computer. Furthermore, it also provides a 10x average speed-up compared to alignment using published cloud-enabled tool for read alignment, Rail-RNA. In the transcript assembly mode, Falco can speed up the transcript assembly process by 1.7–16.5x compared to performing transcript assembly on a highly optimised computer. Falco is a significantly updated open source big data processing framework that enables scalable and accelerated alignment and assembly of full-length scRNA-seq data on the cloud.

With the proliferation of new omics profiling approaches and ever-growing size of data sets generated, there is a lack of tools available to perform and visualise gene set enrichments in analyses involving multiple contrasts. To address this, we developed mitch, an R package for multi-contrast gene set enrichment analysis. It uses a rank-MANOVA statistical approach to identify sets of genes that exhibit joint enrichment across multiple contrasts. Its unique visualisation features enable the exploration of enrichments in up to 20 contrasts. We demonstrate the utility of mitch with case studies spanning multi-contrast RNA expression profiling, integrative multi-omics, tool benchmarking and single-cell RNA sequencing. Using simulated data we show that mitch has similar accuracy to state of the art tools for single-contrast enrichment analysis, and superior accuracy in identifying multi-contrast enrichments. mitch is a versatile tool for rapidly and accurately identifying and visualising gene set enrichments in multi-contrast omics data.

10.1186/s12864-020-07007-w	FALSE	FALSE	I-Impute: a self-consistent method to impute single cell RNA sequencing data	2020-11-18	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is becoming indispensable in the study of cell-specific transcriptomes. However, in scRNA-seq techniques, only a small fraction of the genes are captured due to “dropout” events. These dropout events require intensive treatment when analyzing scRNA-seq data. For example, imputation tools have been proposed to estimate dropout events and de-noise data. The performance of these imputation tools are often evaluated, or fine-tuned, using various clustering criteria based on ground-truth cell subgroup labels. This limits their effectiveness in the cases where we lack cell subgroup knowledge. We consider an alternative strategy which requires the imputation to follow a “self-consistency” principle; that is, the imputation process is to refine its results until there is no internal inconsistency or dropouts from the data. We propose the use of “self-consistency” as a main criteria in performing imputation. To demonstrate this principle we devised I-Impute, a “self-consistent” method, to impute scRNA-seq data. I-Impute optimizes continuous similarities and dropout probabilities, in iterative refinements until a self-consistent imputation is reached. On the in silico data sets, I-Impute exhibited the highest Pearson correlations for different dropout rates consistently compared with the state-of-art methods SAVER and scImpute. Furthermore, we collected three wetlab datasets, mouse bladder cells dataset, embryonic stem cells dataset, and aortic leukocyte cells dataset, to evaluate the tools. I-Impute exhibited feasible cell subpopulation discovery efficacy on all the three datasets. It achieves the highest clustering accuracy compared with SAVER and scImpute. A strategy based on “self-consistency”, captured through our method, I-Impute, gave imputation results better than the state-of-the-art tools.

10.1186/s12864-020-07223-4	FALSE	FALSE	gCAnno: a graph-based single cell type annotation method	2020-11-23	Current single cell analysis methods annotate cell types at cluster-level rather than ideally at single cell level. Multiple exchangeable clustering methods and many tunable parameters have a substantial impact on the clustering outcome, often leading to incorrect cluster-level annotation or multiple runs of subsequent clustering steps. To address these limitations, methods based on well-annotated reference atlas has been proposed. However, these methods are currently not robust enough to handle datasets with different noise levels or from different platforms. Here, we present gCAnno, a graph-based Cell type Annotation method. First, gCAnno constructs cell type-gene bipartite graph and adopts graph embedding to obtain cell type specific genes. Then, naïve Bayes (gCAnno-Bayes) and SVM (gCAnno-SVM) classifiers are built for annotation. We compared the performance of gCAnno to other state-of-art methods on multiple single cell datasets, either with various noise levels or from different platforms. The results showed that gCAnno outperforms other state-of-art methods with higher accuracy and robustness. gCAnno is a robust and accurate cell type annotation tool for single cell RNA analysis.

Currently, no existing software is aimed at identifying single nucleotide variations or micro (1-50 bp) insertions and deletions in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Generating high-quality variant data is vital to the study of the aforementioned diseases, among others. In this study, we report the design and implementation of Red Panda, a novel method to accurately identify variants in scRNA-seq data. Variants were called on scRNA-seq data from human articular chondrocytes, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and simulated data stemming from the MEF alignments. Red Panda had the highest Positive Predictive Value at 45.0%, while other tools—FreeBayes, GATK HaplotypeCaller, GATK UnifiedGenotyper, Monovar, and Platypus—ranged from 5.8–41.53%. From the simulated data, Red Panda had the highest sensitivity at 72.44%. We show that our method provides a novel and improved mechanism to identify variants in scRNA-seq as compared to currently existing software. However, methods for identification of genomic variants using scRNA-seq data can be still improved.	271	0.7419575633127995	8	43	0	0	8.35
10.1186/s12864-020-07302-6	FALSE	FALSE	JOINT for large-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis via soft-clustering and parallel computing	2021-01-11	Single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has provided single-cell level insights into complex biological processes. However, the high frequency of gene expression detection failures in scRNA-Seq data make it challenging to achieve reliable identification of cell-types and Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG). Moreover, with the explosive growth of single-cell data using 10x genomics protocol, existing methods will soon reach the computation limit due to scalability issues. The single-cell transcriptomics field desperately need new tools and framework to facilitate large-scale single-cell analysis. In order to improve the accuracy, robustness, and speed of scRNA-Seq data processing, we propose a generalized zero-inflated negative binomial mixture model, “JOINT,” that can perform probability-based cell-type discovery and DEG analysis simultaneously without the need for imputation. JOINT performs soft-clustering for cell-type identification by computing the probability of individual cells, i.e. each cell can belong to multiple cell types with different probabilities. This is drastically different from existing hard-clustering methods where each cell can only belong to one cell type. The soft-clustering component of the algorithm significantly facilitates the accuracy and robustness of single-cell analysis, especially when the scRNA-Seq datasets are noisy and contain a large number of dropout events. Moreover, JOINT is able to determine the optimal number of cell-types automatically rather than specifying it empirically. The proposed model is an unsupervised learning problem which is solved by using the Expectation and Maximization (EM) algorithm. The EM algorithm is implemented using the TensorFlow deep learning framework, dramatically accelerating the speed for data analysis through parallel GPU computing. Taken together, the JOINT algorithm is accurate and efficient for large-scale scRNA-Seq data analysis via parallel computing. The Python package that we have developed can be readily applied to aid future advances in parallel computing-based single-cell algorithms and research in various biological and biomedical fields.	258	0.7063655030800822	2	29	1	0.003875968992248062	2.25

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods, particularly “full-length” ones, provide read coverage of many individual cells and have the potential to reveal cellular heterogeneity in RNA transcription and processing. However, visualization tools suited to highlighting cell-to-cell heterogeneity in read coverage are still lacking. Here, we have developed Millefy, a tool for visualizing read coverage of scRNA-seq data in genomic contexts. Millefy is designed to show read coverage of all individual cells at once in genomic contexts and to highlight cell-to-cell heterogeneity in read coverage. By visualizing read coverage of all cells as a heat map and dynamically reordering cells based on diffusion maps, Millefy facilitates discovery of “local” region-specific, cell-to-cell heterogeneity in read coverage. We applied Millefy to scRNA-seq data sets of mouse embryonic stem cells and triple-negative breast cancers and showed variability of transcribed regions including antisense RNAs, 3 ′ UTR lengths, and enhancer RNA transcription. Millefy simplifies the examination of cellular heterogeneity in RNA transcription and processing events using scRNA-seq data. Millefy is available as an R package (https://github.com/yuifu/millefy) and as a Docker image for use with Jupyter Notebook (https://hub.docker.com/r/yuifu/datascience-notebook-millefy).	572	1.566050650239562	4	30	2	0.0034965034965034965	90.896

Furthermore, scRNA-seq is almost ubiquitously applicable in medical and biological research. However, these new opportunities are accompanied by additional challenges for researchers regarding data analysis, as advanced technical expertise is required in using bioinformatic software. Here we present WASP, a software for the processing of Drop-Seq-based scRNA-Seq data. Our software facilitates the initial processing of raw reads generated with the ddSEQ or 10x protocol and generates demultiplexed gene expression matrices including quality metrics. The processing pipeline is realized as a Snakemake workflow, while an R Shiny application is provided for interactive result visualization. WASP supports comprehensive analysis of gene expression matrices, including detection of differentially expressed genes, clustering of cellular populations and interactive graphical visualization of the results. The R Shiny application can be used with gene expression matrices generated by the WASP pipeline, as well as with externally provided data from other sources. With WASP we provide an intuitive and easy-to-use tool to process and explore scRNA-seq data. To the best of our knowledge, it is currently the only freely available software package that combines pre- and post-processing of ddSEQ- and 10x-based data. Due to its modular design, it is possible to use any gene expression matrix with WASP’s post-processing R Shiny application. To simplify usage, WASP is provided as a Docker container. Alternatively, pre-processing can be accomplished via Conda, and a standalone version for Windows is available for post-processing, requiring only a web browser.	192	0.5256673511293635	8	20	0	0	5
10.1186/s12864-021-07635-w	FALSE	FALSE	Hierarchicell: an R-package for estimating power for tests of differential expression with single-cell data	2021-05-01	Study design is a critical aspect of any experiment, and sample size calculations for statistical power that are consistent with that study design are central to robust and reproducible results. However, the existing power calculators for tests of differential expression in single-cell RNA-seq data focus on the total number of cells and not the number of independent experimental units, the true unit of interest for power. Thus, current methods grossly overestimate the power. Hierarchicell is the first single-cell power calculator to explicitly simulate and account for the hierarchical correlation structure (i.e., within sample correlation) that exists in single-cell RNA-seq data. Hierarchicell, an R-package available on GitHub, estimates the within sample correlation structure from real data to simulate hierarchical single-cell RNA-seq data and estimate power for tests of differential expression. This multi-stage approach models gene dropout rates, intra-individual dispersion, inter-individual variation, variable or fixed number of cells per individual, and the correlation among cells within an individual. Without modeling the within sample correlation structure and without properly accounting for the correlation in downstream analysis, we demonstrate that estimates of power are falsely inflated. Hierarchicell can be used to estimate power for binary and continuous phenotypes based on user-specified number of independent experimental units (e.g., individuals) and cells within the experimental unit. Hierarchicell is a user-friendly R-package that provides accurate estimates of power for testing hypotheses of differential expression in single-cell RNA-seq data. This R-package represents an important addition to single-cell RNA analytic tools and will help researchers design experiments with appropriate and accurate power, increasing discovery and improving robustness and reproducibility.	148	0.405201916495551	2	19	0	0	8.7
10.1186/s12864-021-07739-3	FALSE	FALSE	Uphyloplot2: visualizing phylogenetic trees from single-cell RNA-seq data	2021-06-05	Recent advances in single cell sequencing technologies allow for greater resolution in assessing tumor clonality using chromosome copy number variations (CNVs). While single cell DNA sequencing technologies are ideal to identify tumor sub-clones, they remain expensive and in contrast to single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) methods are more limited in the data they generate. However, CNV data can be inferred from scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq, for which several tools have been developed, including inferCNV, CaSpER, and HoneyBADGER. Inferences regarding tumor clonality from CNV data (and other sources) are frequently visualized using phylogenetic plots, which previously required time-consuming and error-prone, manual analysis. Here, we present Uphyloplot2, a python script that generates phylogenetic plots directly from inferred RNA-seq data, or any Newick formatted dendrogram file. The tool is publicly available at https://github.com/harbourlab/UPhyloplot2/. Uphyloplot2 is an easy-to-use tool to generate phylogenetic plots to depict tumor clonality from scRNA-seq data and other sources.	113	0.30937713894592744	5	18	0	0	3.75
10.1186/s12864-021-07918-2	FALSE	FALSE	CeTF: an R/Bioconductor package for transcription factor co-expression networks using regulatory impact factors (RIF) and partial correlation and information (PCIT) analysis	2021-08-20	Finding meaningful gene-gene interaction and the main Transcription Factors (TFs) in co-expression networks is one of the most important challenges in gene expression data mining. Here, we developed the R package “CeTF” that integrates the Partial Correlation with Information Theory (PCIT) and Regulatory Impact Factors (RIF) algorithms applied to gene expression data from microarray, RNA-seq, or single-cell RNA-seq platforms. This approach allows identifying the transcription factors most likely to regulate a given network in different biological systems — for example, regulation of gene pathways in tumor stromal cells and tumor cells of the same tumor. This pipeline can be easily integrated into the high-throughput analysis. To demonstrate the CeTF package application, we analyzed gastric cancer RNA-seq data obtained from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) and found the HOXB3 gene as the second most relevant TFs with a high regulatory impact (TFs-HRi) regulating gene pathways in the cell cycle. This preliminary finding shows the potential of CeTF to list master regulators of gene networks. CeTF was designed as a user-friendly tool that provides many highly automated functions without requiring the user to perform many complicated processes. It is available on Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/CeTF) and GitHub (http://github.com/cbiagii/CeTF).	37	0.10130047912388775	8	26	0	0	2.25
10.1186/s12864-021-07974-8	FALSE	FALSE	SCReadCounts: estimation of cell-level SNVs expression from scRNA-seq data	2021-09-22	Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of scRNA-seq SNVs to distinguish tumor from normal cells, characterize intra-tumoral heterogeneity, and define mutation-associated expression signatures. In addition to cancer studies, SNVs from single cells have been useful in studies of transcriptional burst kinetics, allelic expression, chromosome X inactivation, ploidy estimations, and haplotype inference. To aid these types of studies, we have developed a tool, SCReadCounts, for cell-level tabulation of the sequencing read counts bearing SNV reference and variant alleles from barcoded scRNA-seq alignments. Provided genomic loci and expected alleles, SCReadCounts generates cell-SNV matrices with the absolute variant- and reference-harboring read counts, as well as cell-SNV matrices of expressed Variant Allele Fraction (VAFRNA) suitable for a variety of downstream applications. We demonstrate three different SCReadCounts applications on 59,884 cells from seven neuroblastoma samples: (1) estimation of cell-level expression of known somatic mutations and RNA-editing sites, (2) estimation of cell- level allele expression of biallelic SNVs, and (3) a discovery mode assessment of the reference and each of the three alternative nucleotides at genomic positions of interest that does not require prior SNV information. For the later, we applied SCReadCounts on the coding regions of KRAS, where it identified known and novel somatic mutations in a low-to-moderate proportion of cells. The SCReadCounts read counts module is benchmarked against the analogous modules of GATK and Samtools. SCReadCounts is freely available (https://github.com/HorvathLab/NGS) as 64-bit self-contained binary distributions for Linux and MacOS, in addition to Python source. SCReadCounts supplies a fast and efficient solution for estimation of cell-level SNV expression from scRNA-seq data. SCReadCounts enables distinguishing cells with monoallelic reference expression from those with no gene expression and is applicable to assess SNVs present in only a small proportion of the cells, such as somatic mutations in cancer.	4	0.010951403148528405	8	44	0	0	4.5

Its application in samples from xenografts of patient-derived biopsies (PDX), however, is limited by the presence of cells originating from both the host and the graft in the analysed samples; in fact, in the bioinformatics workflows it is still a challenge discriminating between host and graft sequence reads obtained in a single-cell experiment. We have developed XenoCell, the first stand-alone pre-processing tool that performs fast and reliable classification of host and graft cellular barcodes from single-cell sequencing experiments. We show its application on a mixed species 50:50 cell line experiment from 10× Genomics platform, and on a publicly available PDX dataset obtained by Drop-Seq.

We propose simple multinomial methods, including generalized principal component analysis (GLM-PCA) for non-normal distributions, and feature selection using deviance. These methods outperform the current practice in a downstream clustering assessment using ground truth datasets.	643	1.7604380561259412	4	62	98	0.15241057542768274	110.18

An important facet of these studies is the ability to identify the transcriptional signatures that define a cell type or state. In theory, this information can be used to classify an individual cell based on its transcriptional profile. Here, we present scPred, a new generalizable method that is able to provide highly accurate classification of single cells, using a combination of unbiased feature selection from a reduced-dimension space, and machine-learning probability-based prediction method. We apply scPred to scRNA-seq data from pancreatic tissue, mononuclear cells, colorectal tumor biopsies, and circulating dendritic cells and show that scPred is able to classify individual cells with high accuracy.

Existing demultiplexing strategies rely on availability of complete genotype data from the pooled samples, which limits the applicability of such methods, in particular when genetic variation is not the primary object of study. To address this, we here present Vireo, a computationally efficient Bayesian model to demultiplex single-cell data from pooled experimental designs. Uniquely, our model can be applied in settings when only partial or no genotype information is available. Using pools based on synthetic mixtures and results on real data, we demonstrate the robustness of Vireo and illustrate the utility of multiplexed experimental designs for common expression analyses.	653	1.787816563997262	3	25	37	0.05666156202143951	47.33

To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from “regularized negative binomial regression,” where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression. Our approach can be applied to any UMI-based scRNA-seq dataset and is freely available as part of the R package , with a direct interface to our single-cell toolkit .	643	1.7604380561259412	2	39	554	0.8615863141524106	63.38

We propose DENDRO, an analysis method for scRNA-seq data that clusters single cells into genetically distinct subclones and reconstructs the phylogenetic tree relating the subclones. DENDRO utilizes transcribed point mutations and accounts for technical noise and expression stochasticity. We benchmark DENDRO and demonstrate its application on simulation data and real data from three cancer types. In particular, on a mouse melanoma model in response to immunotherapy, DENDRO delineates the role of neoantigens in treatment response.	621	1.700205338809035	4	92	11	0.017713365539452495	21.7

Compared with seven state-of-the-art imputation approaches on ten real-world datasets, we show that DISC consistently outperforms the other approaches.

However, its utility for biological discovery has so far been limited, given that generic deep neural networks provide little insight into the biological mechanisms that underlie a successful prediction. Here we demonstrate deep learning on biological networks, where every node has a molecular equivalent, such as a protein or gene, and every edge has a mechanistic interpretation, such as a regulatory interaction along a signaling pathway. With knowledge-primed neural networks (KPNNs), we exploit the ability of deep learning algorithms to assign meaningful weights in multi-layered networks, resulting in a widely applicable approach for interpretable deep learning. We present a learning method that enhances the interpretability of trained KPNNs by stabilizing node weights in the presence of redundancy, enhancing the quantitative interpretability of node weights, and controlling for uneven connectivity in biological networks. We validate KPNNs on simulated data with known ground truth and demonstrate their practical use and utility in five biological applications with single-cell RNA-seq data for cancer and immune cells. We introduce KPNNs as a method that combines the predictive power of deep learning with the interpretability of biological networks. While demonstrated here on single-cell sequencing data, this method is broadly relevant to other research areas where prior domain knowledge can be represented as networks.	419	1.1471594798083504	2	126	10	0.02386634844868735	108.81

We show that BRIE2 effectively identifies differential disease-associated alternative splicing events and allows a principled selection of genes that capture heterogeneity in transcriptional kinetics and improve RNA velocity analyses, enabling the identification of splicing phenotypes associated with biological changes.	30	0.08213552361396304	2	34	0	0	18.75

Assignment of single cells to their tumor clones of origin can be approached by matching the genotypes of the clones to the mutations found in RNA sequencing of the cells. The confidence of the cell-to-clone mapping can be increased by accounting for additional measurements. Follicular lymphoma, a malignancy of mature B cells that continuously acquire mutations in parallel in the exome and in B cell receptor loci, presents a unique opportunity to join exome-derived mutations with B cell receptor sequences as independent sources of evidence for clonal evolution. Here, we propose CACTUS, a probabilistic model that leverages the information from an independent genomic clustering of cells and exploits the scarce single cell RNA sequencing data to map single cells to given imperfect genotypes of tumor clones. We apply CACTUS to two follicular lymphoma patient samples, integrating three measurements: whole exome, single-cell RNA, and B cell receptor sequencing. CACTUS outperforms a predecessor model by confidently assigning cells and B cell receptor-based clusters to the tumor clones. The integration of independent measurements increases model certainty and is the key to improving model performance in the challenging task of charting the genotype-to-phenotype maps in tumors. CACTUS opens the avenue to study the functional implications of tumor heterogeneity, and origins of resistance to targeted therapies. CACTUS is written in R and source code, along with all supporting files, are available on GitHub (https://github.com/LUMC/CACTUS).	186	0.5092402464065708	11	45	0	0	7.6

We present netSmooth, a network-diffusion based method that uses priors for the covariance structure of gene expression profiles on scRNA-seq experiments in order to smooth expression values.

10.12688/f1000research.16198.1	FALSE	FALSE	scClustViz – Single-cell RNAseq cluster assessment and visualization	2018-09-21	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) represents a new kind of microscope that can measure the transcriptome profiles of thousands of individual cells from complex cellular mixtures, such as in a tissue, in a single experiment. This technology is particularly valuable for characterization of tissue heterogeneity because it can be used to identify and classify all cell types in a tissue. This is generally done by clustering the data, based on the assumption that cells of a particular type share similar transcriptomes, distinct from other cell types in the tissue. However, nearly all clustering algorithms have tunable parameters which affect the number of clusters they will identify in data. The R Shiny software tool described here, scClustViz, provides a simple interactive graphical user interface for exploring scRNAseq data and assessing the biological relevance of clustering results. Given that cell types are expected to have distinct gene expression patterns, scClustViz uses differential gene expression between clusters as a metric for assessing the fit of a clustering result to the data at multiple cluster resolution levels. This helps select a clustering parameter for further analysis. scClustViz also provides interactive visualisation of: cluster-specific distributions of technical factors, such as predicted cell cycle stage and other metadata; cluster-wise gene expression statistics to simplify annotation of cell types and identification of cell type specific marker genes; and gene expression distributions over all cells and cell types. scClustViz provides an interactive interface for visualisation, assessment, and biological interpretation of cell-type classifications in scRNAseq experiments that can be easily added to existing analysis pipelines, enabling customization by bioinformaticians while enabling biologists to explore their results without the need for computational expertise.

Applying network biology approaches to scRNA-seq data can provide useful insights into genes driving heterogeneous cell-type compositions of tissues. Here, we present scNetViz — a Cytoscape app to aid biological interpretation of cell clusters in scRNA-seq data using network analysis. scNetViz calculates the differential expression of each gene across clusters and then creates a cluster-specific gene functional interaction network between the significantly differentially expressed genes for further analysis, such as pathway enrichment analysis. To automate a complete data analysis workflow, scNetViz integrates parts of the Scanpy software, which is a popular Python package for scRNA-seq data analysis, with Cytoscape apps such as stringApp, cyPlot, and enhancedGraphics. We describe our implementation of methods for accessing data from public single cell atlas projects, differential expression analysis, visualization, and automation. scNetViz enables users to analyze data from public atlases or their own experiments, which we illustrate with two use cases. Analysis can be performed via the Cytoscape GUI or CyREST programming interface using R (RCy3) or Python (py4cytoscape).	111	0.30390143737166325	6	33	0	0	8.25
10.12688/wellcomeopenres.11087.1	FALSE	FALSE	Probabilistic modeling of bifurcations in single-cell gene expression data using a Bayesian mixture of factor analyzers	2017-03-15	Modeling bifurcations in single-cell transcriptomics data has become an increasingly popular field of research. Several methods have been proposed to infer bifurcation structure from such data, but all rely on heuristic non-probabilistic inference. Here we propose the first generative, fully probabilistic model for such inference based on a Bayesian hierarchical mixture of factor analyzers. Our model exhibits competitive performance on large datasets despite implementing full Markov-Chain Monte Carlo sampling, and its unique hierarchical prior structure enables automatic determination of genes driving the bifurcation process. We additionally propose an Empirical-Bayes like extension that deals with the high levels of zero-inflation in single-cell RNA-seq data and quantify when such models are useful. We apply or model to both real and simulated single-cell gene expression data and compare the results to existing pseudotime methods. Finally, we discuss both the merits and weaknesses of such a unified, probabilistic approach in the context practical bioinformatics analyses.	1656	4.5338809034907595	2	18	18	0.010869565217391304	12.846

A number of alignment methods have been developed to enable the integration and comparison of scRNA-Seq data from such studies. While each performs well on some of the datasets, to date no method was able to both perform the alignment using the original expression space and generalize to new data. To enable such analysis we developed Single Cell Iterative Point set Registration (SCIPR) which extends methods that were successfully applied to align image data to scRNA-Seq. We discuss the required changes needed, the resulting optimization function, and algorithms for learning a transformation function for aligning data. We tested SCIPR on several scRNA-Seq datasets. As we show it successfully aligns data from several different cell types, improving upon prior methods proposed for this task. In addition, we show the parameters learned by SCIPR can be used to align data not used in the training and to identify key cell type-specific genes.	334	0.9144421629021219	2	43	0	0	13.296
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008094	FALSE	FALSE	Pseudocell Tracer—A method for inferring dynamic trajectories using scRNAseq and its application to B cells undergoing immunoglobulin class switch recombination	2021-05-03	Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) can be used to infer a temporal ordering of cellular states. Current methods for the inference of cellular trajectories rely on unbiased dimensionality reduction techniques. However, such biologically agnostic ordering can prove difficult for modeling complex developmental or differentiation processes. The cellular heterogeneity of dynamic biological compartments can result in sparse sampling of key intermediate cell states. To overcome these limitations, we develop a supervised machine learning framework, called Pseudocell Tracer, which infers trajectories in pseudospace rather than in pseudotime. The method uses a supervised encoder, trained with adjacent biological information, to project scRNAseq data into a low-dimensional manifold that maps the transcriptional states a cell can occupy. Then a generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to simulate pesudocells at regular intervals along a virtual cell-state axis. We demonstrate the utility of Pseudocell Tracer by modeling B cells undergoing immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) during a prototypic antigen-induced antibody response. Our results revealed an ordering of key transcription factors regulating CSR to the IgG1 isotype, including the concomitant expression of Nfkb1 and Stat6 prior to the upregulation of Bach2 expression. Furthermore, the expression dynamics of genes encoding cytokine receptors suggest a poised IL-4 signaling state that preceeds CSR to the IgG1 isotype.	146	0.3997262149212868	8	36	1	0.00684931506849315	2.45

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008569	FALSE	FALSE	Optimal tuning of weighted kNN- and diffusion-based methods for denoising single cell genomics data	2021-01-07	The analysis of single-cell genomics data presents several statistical challenges, and extensive efforts have been made to produce methods for the analysis of this data that impute missing values, address sampling issues and quantify and correct for noise. In spite of such efforts, no consensus on best practices has been established and all current approaches vary substantially based on the available data and empirical tests. The k-Nearest Neighbor Graph (kNN-G) is often used to infer the identities of, and relationships between, cells and is the basis of many widely used dimensionality-reduction and projection methods. The kNN-G has also been the basis for imputation methods using, e.g., neighbor averaging and graph diffusion. However, due to the lack of an agreed-upon optimal objective function for choosing hyperparameters, these methods tend to oversmooth data, thereby resulting in a loss of information with regard to cell identity and the specific gene-to-gene patterns underlying regulatory mechanisms. In this paper, we investigate the tuning of kNN- and diffusion-based denoising methods with a novel non-stochastic method for optimally preserving biologically relevant informative variance in single-cell data. The framework, Denoising Expression data with a Weighted Affinity Kernel and Self-Supervision (DEWÄKSS), uses a self-supervised technique to tune its parameters. We demonstrate that denoising with optimal parameters selected by our objective function (i) is robust to preprocessing methods using data from established benchmarks, (ii) disentangles cellular identity and maintains robust clusters over dimension-reduction methods, (iii) maintains variance along several expression dimensions, unlike previous heuristic-based methods that tend to oversmooth data variance, and (iv) rarely involves diffusion but rather uses a fixed weighted kNN graph for denoising. Together, these findings provide a new understanding of kNN- and diffusion-based denoising methods. Code and example data for DEWÄKSS is available at https://gitlab.com/Xparx/dewakss/-/tree/Tjarnberg2020branch.	262	0.7173169062286106	7	44	5	0.019083969465648856	3.25
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008625	FALSE	FALSE	mbkmeans: Fast clustering for single cell data using mini-batch k-means	2021-01-26	Single-cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used high-throughput technology to measure genome-wide gene expression at the single-cell level. One of the most common analyses of scRNA-seq data detects distinct subpopulations of cells through the use of unsupervised clustering algorithms. However, recent advances in scRNA-seq technologies result in current datasets ranging from thousands to millions of cells. Popular clustering algorithms, such as k-means, typically require the data to be loaded entirely into memory and therefore can be slow or impossible to run with large datasets. To address this problem, we developed the mbkmeans R/Bioconductor package, an open-source implementation of the mini-batch k-means algorithm. Our package allows for on-disk data representations, such as the common HDF5 file format widely used for single-cell data, that do not require all the data to be loaded into memory at one time. We demonstrate the performance of the mbkmeans package using large datasets, including one with 1.3 million cells. We also highlight and compare the computing performance of mbkmeans against the standard implementation of k-means and other popular single-cell clustering methods. Our software package is available in Bioconductor at https://bioconductor.org/packages/mbkmeans.	243	0.6652977412731006	5	54	3	0.012345679012345678	14.2
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008804	FALSE	FALSE	JSOM: Jointly-evolving self-organizing maps for alignment of biological datasets and identification of related clusters	2021-03-16	With the rapid advances of various single-cell technologies, an increasing number of single-cell datasets are being generated, and the computational tools for aligning the datasets which make subsequent integration or meta-analysis possible have become critical. Typically, single-cell datasets from different technologies cannot be directly combined or concatenated, due to the innate difference in the data, such as the number of measured parameters and the distributions. Even datasets generated by the same technology are often affected by the batch effect. A computational approach for aligning different datasets and hence identifying related clusters will be useful for data integration and interpretation in large scale single-cell experiments. Our proposed algorithm called JSOM, a variation of the Self-organizing map, aligns two related datasets that contain similar clusters, by constructing two maps—low-dimensional discretized representation of datasets–that jointly evolve according to both datasets. Here we applied the JSOM algorithm to flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. The resulting JSOM maps not only align the related clusters in the two datasets but also preserve the topology of the datasets so that the maps could be used for further analysis, such as clustering.	194	0.5311430527036276	2	29	0	0	2.6
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009029	FALSE	FALSE	G2S3: A gene graph-based imputation method for single-cell RNA sequencing data	2021-05-18	Single-cell RNA sequencing technology provides an opportunity to study gene expression at single-cell resolution. However, prevalent dropout events result in high data sparsity and noise that may obscure downstream analyses in single-cell transcriptomic studies. We propose a new method, G2S3, that imputes dropouts by borrowing information from adjacent genes in a sparse gene graph learned from gene expression profiles across cells. We applied G2S3 and ten existing imputation methods to eight single-cell transcriptomic datasets and compared their performance. Our results demonstrated that G2S3 has superior overall performance in recovering gene expression, identifying cell subtypes, reconstructing cell trajectories, identifying differentially expressed genes, and recovering gene regulatory and correlation relationships. Moreover, G2S3 is computationally efficient for imputation in large-scale single-cell transcriptomic datasets.	131	0.3586584531143053	5	49	2	0.015267175572519083	15.63

These datasets, including scRNA-seq data, scATAC-seq data and sc-methylation data, usually have different powers in identifying the unknown cell types through clustering. So, methods that integrate multiple datasets can potentially lead to a better clustering performance. Here we propose coupleCoC+ for the integrative analysis of single-cell genomic data. coupleCoC+ is a transfer learning method based on the information-theoretic co-clustering framework. In coupleCoC+, we utilize the information in one dataset, the source data, to facilitate the analysis of another dataset, the target data. coupleCoC+ uses the linked features in the two datasets for effective knowledge transfer, and it also uses the information of the features in the target data that are unlinked with the source data. In addition, coupleCoC+ matches similar cell types across the source data and the target data. By applying coupleCoC+ to the integrative clustering of mouse cortex scATAC-seq data and scRNA-seq data, mouse and human scRNA-seq data, mouse cortex sc-methylation and scRNA-seq data, and human blood dendritic cells scRNA-seq data from two batches, we demonstrate that coupleCoC+ improves the overall clustering performance and matches the cell subpopulations across multimodal single-cell genomic datasets. coupleCoC+ has fast convergence and it is computationally efficient.

As the low amount of extracted mRNA copies per cell, scRNA-seq data exhibit a large number of dropouts, which hinders the downstream analysis of the scRNA-seq data. We propose a statistical method, SDImpute (Single-cell RNA-seq Dropout Imputation), to implement block imputation for dropout events in scRNA-seq data. SDImpute automatically identifies the dropout events based on the gene expression levels and the variations of gene expression across similar cells and similar genes, and it implements block imputation for dropouts by utilizing gene expression unaffected by dropouts from similar cells. In the experiments, the results of the simulated datasets and real datasets suggest that SDImpute is an effective tool to recover the data and preserve the heterogeneity of gene expression across cells. Compared with the state-of-the-art imputation methods, SDImpute improves the accuracy of the downstream analysis including clustering, visualization, and differential expression analysis.	101	0.27652292950034224	4	36	1	0.009900990099009901	17.33
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009290	FALSE	FALSE	miQC: An adaptive probabilistic framework for quality control of single-cell RNA-sequencing data	2021-08-24	Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has made it possible to profile gene expression in tissues at high resolution. An important preprocessing step prior to performing downstream analyses is to identify and remove cells with poor or degraded sample quality using quality control (QC) metrics. Two widely used QC metrics to identify a ‘low-quality’ cell are (i) if the cell includes a high proportion of reads that map to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded genes and (ii) if a small number of genes are detected. Current best practices use these QC metrics independently with either arbitrary, uniform thresholds (e.g. 5%) or biological context-dependent (e.g. species) thresholds, and fail to jointly model these metrics in a data-driven manner. Current practices are often overly stringent and especially untenable on certain types of tissues, such as archived tumor tissues, or tissues associated with mitochondrial function, such as kidney tissue [1]. We propose a data-driven QC metric (miQC) that jointly models both the proportion of reads mapping to mtDNA genes and the number of detected genes with mixture models in a probabilistic framework to predict the low-quality cells in a given dataset. We demonstrate how our QC metric easily adapts to different types of single-cell datasets to remove low-quality cells while preserving high-quality cells that can be used for downstream analyses.

10.1371/journal.pone.0243360	FALSE	FALSE	DSAVE: Detection of misclassified cells in single-cell RNA-Seq data	2020-12-03	Single-cell RNA sequencing has become a valuable tool for investigating cell types in complex tissues, where clustering of cells enables the identification and comparison of cell populations. Although many studies have sought to develop and compare different clustering approaches, a deeper investigation into the properties of the resulting populations is lacking. Specifically, the presence of misclassified cells can influence downstream analyses, highlighting the need to assess subpopulation purity and to detect such cells. We developed DSAVE (Down-SAmpling based Variation Estimation), a method to evaluate the purity of single-cell transcriptome clusters and to identify misclassified cells. The method utilizes down-sampling to eliminate differences in sampling noise and uses a log-likelihood based metric to help identify misclassified cells. In addition, DSAVE estimates the number of cells needed in a population to achieve a stable average gene expression profile within a certain gene expression range. We show that DSAVE can be used to find potentially misclassified cells that are not detectable by similar tools and reveal the cause of their divergence from the other cells, such as differing cell state or cell type. With the growing use of single-cell RNA-seq, we foresee that DSAVE will be an increasingly useful tool for comparing and purifying subpopulations in single-cell RNA-Seq datasets.	297	0.813141683778234	6	42	0	0	10.096

However, the data is noise-prone due to experimental errors and cell type-specific biases. Current computational approaches for analyzing single-cell data involve a global normalization step which introduces incorrect biases and spurious noise and does not resolve missing data (dropouts). This can lead to misleading conclusions in downstream analyses. Moreover, a single normalization removes important cell type-specific information. We propose a data-driven model, BISCUIT, that iteratively normalizes and clusters cells, thereby separating noise from interesting biological signals. BISCUIT is a Bayesian probabilistic model that learns cell-specific parameters to intelligently drive normalization. This approach displays superior performance to global normalization followed by clustering in both synthetic and real single-cell data compared with previous methods, and allows easy interpretation and recovery of the underlying structure and cell types.	1704	4.6652977412731005	4	0	28	0.01643192488262911	NA

10.21203/rs.2.22114/v1	FALSE	TRUE	SCC: An accurate modification method for scRNA-seq dropouts based on mixture model	2020-01-29	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has advanced in past decade, which enables gene expression analysis to be carried out at higher resolution. This technology is of great significance for exploring the dynamic development process of life, studying the regulation mechanism of genes and discovering new cell types. However, there are still some limitations in scRNA-seq technology. The primary limitation is the high noisy in scRNA-seq data. The main reason is the poor sensitivity of scRNA-seq technology. This technology only detect 5-15 percent of the mRNA molecules. Therefore, low-expression genes are difficult to detect in scRNA-seq data. The scRNA-seq data tend to be bimodal expression distribution because the expression is either strongly zero or high expression. In this paper, we proposal a method scRNA-seq complementation (SCC) to solve the dropouts in scRNA-seq data. Firstly, we find the nearest neighbor cells of every cell, and then use a mixture model to impute the dropouts of scRNA-seq data. The model can identifies the possibility of dropouts and estimates the reasonable gene expression value. The result shows that SCC significantly reduce the intra-class distance of cells and enhance the clustering of cell subpopulation, which is significant for future research on gene expression.

Since single cell data is susceptible to technical noise, the quality of genes selected prior to clustering is of crucial importance in the preliminary steps of downstream analysis. Therefore, interest in robust gene selection has gained considerable attention in recent years. We introduce sc-REnF, (robust entropy based feature (gene) selection method), aiming to leverage the advantages of Rényi and Tsallis&gt; entropies in gene selection for single cell clustering. Experiments demonstrate that with tuned parameter (q), Rényi and Tsallis entropies select genes that improved the clustering results significantly, over the other competing methods. sc-REnF can capture relevancy and redundancy among the features of noisy data extremely well due to its robust objective function. Moreover, the selected features/genes can able to clusters the unknown cells with a high accuracy. Finally, sc-REnF yields good clustering performance in small sample, large feature scRNA-seq data.	167	0.45722108145106094	4	0	1	0.005988023952095809	NA
10.21203/rs.3.rs-36926/v1	FALSE	TRUE	gCAnno: A Graph-based Single Cell Type Annotation Method	2020-07-16	Background Current single cell analysis methods annotate cell types at cluster-level rather than ideally at single cell level. Multiple exchangeable clustering methods and many tunable parameters have a substantial impact on the clustering outcome, often leading to incorrect cluster-level annotation or multiple runs of subsequent clustering steps. To address these limitations, methods based on well-annotated reference atlas has been proposed. However, these methods are currently not robust enough to handle datasets with different noise levels or from different platforms. Results Here, we present gCAnno, a graph-based Cell type Annotation method. First, gCAnno constructs cell type-gene bipartite graph and adopts graph embedding to obtain cell type specific genes. Then, a naïve Bayes classifier is built for annotation. We compared the performance of gCAnno to other state-of-art methods on multiple single cell datasets, either with various noise levels or from different platforms. The results showed that gCAnno outperforms other state-of-art methods with higher accuracy and robustness. Conclusions gCAnno is a robust and accurate cell type annotation tool for single cell RNA analysis.

10.21203/rs.3.rs-418249/v1	FALSE	TRUE	MarkerCount: A stable, count-based cell type identifier for single cell RNA-Seq experiments	2021-04-19	Cell type identification is a key step to downstream analysis of single cell RNA-seq experiments. Indispensible information for this is gene expression, which is used to cluster cells, train the model and set rejection thresholds. Problem is they are subject to batch effect arising from different platforms and preprocessing. We present MarkerCount, which uses the number of markers expressed regardless of their expression level to initially identify cell types and, then, reassign cell type in cluster-basis. MarkerCount works both in reference and marker-based mode, where the latter utilizes only the existing lists of markers, while the former required pre-annotated dataset to train the model. The performance was evaluated and compared with the existing identifiers, both marker and reference-based, that can be customized with publicly available datasets and marker DB. The results show that MarkerCount provides a stable performance when comparing with other reference-based and marker-based cell type identifiers.	160	0.4380561259411362	4	0	0	0	0.5

Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics have contributed to unraveling the cellular composition of tissues and enabled the development of computational algorithms to predict cellular communication mediated by ligand-receptor interactions. Despite the existence of various tools capable of inferring cell-cell interactions from single-cell RNA sequencing data, the analysis and interpretation of the biological signals often require deep computational expertise. Here we present InterCellar, an interactive platform empowering lab-scientists to analyze and explore predicted cell-cell communication without requiring programming skills. InterCellar guides the biological interpretation through customized analysis steps, several visualization options and the possibility to link biological pathways to ligand-receptor interactions. By analyzing COVID-19 and melanoma cell-cell interactions, we show that InterCellar resolves data-driven patterns of communication and highlights molecular signals through the integration of biological functions and pathways.	97	0.2655715263518138	3	0	0	0	1.35

A significant drawback of currently available algorithms is the need to use empirical parameters or rely on indirect quality measures to estimate the degree of complexity, i.e., the number of subgroups present in the sample. We fill this gap with a single-cell data analysis procedure allowing for unambiguous assessments of the depth of heterogeneity in subclonal compositions supported by data. Our approach combines nonnegative matrix factorization, which takes advantage of the sparse and nonnegative nature of single-cell RNA count data, with Bayesian model comparison enabling de novo prediction of the depth of heterogeneity. We show that the method predicts the correct number of subgroups using simulated data, primary blood mononuclear cell, and pancreatic cell data. We applied our approach to a collection of single-cell tumor samples and found two qualitatively distinct classes of cell-type heterogeneity in cancer microenvironments.	817	2.236824093086927	5	73	3	0.0036719706242350062	2
10.26508/lsa.202000986	FALSE	FALSE	PieParty: visualizing cells from scRNA-seq data as pie charts	2021-03-05	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been a transformative technology in many research fields. Dimensional reduction techniques such as UMAP and tSNE are used to visualize scRNA-seq data in two or three dimensions for cells to be clustered in biologically meaningful ways. Subsequently, gene expression is frequently mapped onto these plots to show the distribution of gene expression across the plots, for instance to distinguish cell types. However, plotting each cell with only a single color leads to repetitive and unintuitive representations. Here, we present PieParty, which allows scRNA-seq data to be plotted such that every cell is represented as a pie chart, and every slice in the pie charts corresponds to the gene expression of a single gene. This allows for the simultaneous visualization of the expression of multiple genes and gene networks. The resulting figures are information dense, space efficient, and highly intuitive.

Although there are various tools and methods to correct for batch effects, their performance can vary. Therefore, it is important to understand how batch effects manifest to adjust for them. Here, we systematically explore batch effects across various scRNA-seq datasets according to magnitude, cell type specificity, and complexity. We developed a cell-specific mixing score (cms) that quantifies mixing of cells from multiple batches. By considering distance distributions, the score is able to detect local batch bias as well as differentiate between unbalanced batches and systematic differences between cells of the same cell type. We compare metrics in scRNA-seq data using real and synthetic datasets and whereas these metrics target the same question and are used interchangeably, we find differences in scalability, sensitivity, and ability to handle differentially abundant cell types. We find that cell-specific metrics outperform cell type–specific and global metrics and recommend them for both method benchmarks and batch exploration.	187	0.5119780971937029	8	39	3	0.016042780748663103	25.846

However, current analyses of scRNA-Seq data usually start from unsupervised clustering or visualization. These methods ignore the prior knowledge of transcriptomes and of the probable structures of the data. Moreover, cell identification heavily relies on subjective and inaccurate human inspection afterwards. To address these analytical challenges, we developed the Semi-supervised Category Identification and Assignment (SCINA) algorithm, a semi-supervised model, for analyses of scRNA-Seq and flow cytometry/CyTOF data, and other data of similar format, by automatically exploiting previously established gene signatures using an expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm. We applied SCINA on a wide range of datasets, and showed its accuracy, stableness and efficiency exceeded most popular unsupervised approaches. SCINA discovered an intermediate stage of oligodendrocyte from mouse brain scRNA-Seq data. SCINA also detected immune cell population shifting in Stk4 knock-out -knockoutmouse cytometry data. Finally, SCINA identified a new kidney tumor clade with similarity to FH-deficient tumors from bulk tumor data. Overall, SCINA provides both methodological advances and biological insights from perspectives different from traditional analytical methods.	807	2.209445585215606	15	0	39	0.048327137546468404	10.5

False zeros, which can be seen as missing data, obstruct the downstream analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. How to distinguish true zeros from false ones is the key point of this problem. Here, we propose sparsity-penalized stacked denoising autoencoders (scSDAEs) to impute scRNA-seq data. scSDAEs adopt stacked denoising autoencoders with a sparsity penalty, as well as a layer-wise pretraining procedure to improve model fitting. scSDAEs can capture nonlinear relationships among the data and incorporate information about the observed zeros. We tested the imputation efficiency of scSDAEs on recovering the true values of gene expression and helping downstream analysis. First, we show that scSDAE can recover the true values and the sample–sample correlations of bulk sequencing data with simulated noise. Next, we demonstrate that scSDAEs accurately impute RNA mixture dataset with different dilutions, spike-in RNA concentrations affected by technical zeros, and improves the consistency of RNA and protein levels in CITE-seq data. Finally, we show that scSDAEs can help downstream clustering analysis. In this study, we develop a deep learning-based method, scSDAE, to impute single-cell RNA-seq affected by technical zeros. Furthermore, we show that scSDAEs can recover the true values, to some extent, and help downstream analysis.	503	1.377138945927447	2	52	1	0.0019880715705765406	10.58
10.3390/genes11070792	FALSE	FALSE	Integrating Deep Supervised, Self-Supervised and Unsupervised Learning for Single-Cell RNA-seq Clustering and Annotation	2020-07-14	As single-cell RNA sequencing technologies mature, massive gene expression profiles can be obtained. Consequently, cell clustering and annotation become two crucial and fundamental procedures affecting other specific downstream analyses. Most existing single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data clustering algorithms do not take into account the available cell annotation results on the same tissues or organisms from other laboratories. Nonetheless, such data could assist and guide the clustering process on the target dataset. Identifying marker genes through differential expression analysis to manually annotate large amounts of cells also costs labor and resources. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end cell supervised clustering and annotation framework called scAnCluster, which fully utilizes the cell type labels available from reference data to facilitate the cell clustering and annotation on the unlabeled target data. Our algorithm integrates deep supervised learning, self-supervised learning and unsupervised learning techniques together, and it outperforms other customized scRNA-seq supervised clustering methods in both simulation and real data. It is particularly worth noting that our method performs well on the challenging task of discovering novel cell types that are absent in the reference data.	439	1.2019164955509924	5	45	4	0.009111617312072893	5.6
10.3390/genes12020311	FALSE	FALSE	Clustering Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data with Regularized Gaussian Graphical Model	2021-02-22	Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool to measure the expression patterns of individual cells and discover heterogeneity and functional diversity among cell populations. Due to variability, it is challenging to analyze such data efficiently. Many clustering methods have been developed using at least one free parameter. Different choices for free parameters may lead to substantially different visualizations and clusters. Tuning free parameters is also time consuming. Thus there is need for a simple, robust, and efficient clustering method. In this paper, we propose a new regularized Gaussian graphical clustering (RGGC) method for scRNA-seq data. RGGC is based on high-order (partial) correlations and subspace learning, and is robust over a wide-range of a regularized parameter λ. Therefore, we can simply set λ=2 or λ=log(p) for AIC (Akaike information criterion) or BIC (Bayesian information criterion) without cross-validation. Cell subpopulations are discovered by the Louvain community detection algorithm that determines the number of clusters automatically. There is no free parameter to be tuned with RGGC. When evaluated with simulated and benchmark scRNA-seq data sets against widely used methods, RGGC is computationally efficient and one of the top performers. It can detect inter-sample cell heterogeneity, when applied to glioblastoma scRNA-seq data.	216	0.5913757700205339	1	34	0	0	NA

10.7554/eLife.43803	FALSE	FALSE	Identifying gene expression programs of cell-type identity and cellular activity with single-cell RNA-Seq	2019-07-08	Identifying gene expression programs underlying both cell-type identity and cellular activities (e.g. life-cycle processes, responses to environmental cues) is crucial for understanding the organization of cells and tissues. Although single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) can quantify transcripts in individual cells, each cell’s expression profile may be a mixture of both types of programs, making them difficult to disentangle. Here, we benchmark and enhance the use of matrix factorization to solve this problem. We show with simulations that a method we call consensus non-negative matrix factorization (cNMF) accurately infers identity and activity programs, including their relative contributions in each cell. To illustrate the insights this approach enables, we apply it to published brain organoid and visual cortex scRNA-Seq datasets; cNMF refines cell types and identifies both expected (e.g. cell cycle and hypoxia) and novel activity programs, including programs that may underlie a neurosecretory phenotype and synaptogenesis.	811	2.220396988364134	7	60	60	0.07398273736128237	25.2
10.7554/eLife.48994	FALSE	FALSE	Self-assembling manifolds in single-cell RNA sequencing data	2019-09-16	Single-cell RNA sequencing has spurred the development of computational methods that enable researchers to classify cell types, delineate developmental trajectories, and measure molecular responses to external perturbations. Many of these technologies rely on their ability to detect genes whose cell-to-cell variations arise from the biological processes of interest rather than transcriptional or technical noise. However, for datasets in which the biologically relevant differences between cells are subtle, identifying these genes is challenging. We present the self-assembling manifold (SAM) algorithm, an iterative soft feature selection strategy to quantify gene relevance and improve dimensionality reduction. We demonstrate its advantages over other state-of-the-art methods with experimental validation in identifying novel stem cell populations of Schistosoma mansoni, a prevalent parasite that infects hundreds of millions of people. Extending our analysis to a total of 56 datasets, we show that SAM is generalizable and consistently outperforms other methods in a variety of biological and quantitative benchmarks.	741	2.028747433264887	5	47	14	0.018893387314439947	17.346
10.7717/peerj.10469	FALSE	FALSE	BingleSeq: a user-friendly R package for bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq data analysis	2020-12-22	RNA sequencing is an indispensable research tool used in a broad range of transcriptome analysis studies. The most common application of RNA Sequencing is differential expression analysis and it is used to determine genetic loci with distinct expression across different conditions. An emerging field called single-cell RNA sequencing is used for transcriptome profiling at the individual cell level. The standard protocols for both of these approaches include the processing of sequencing libraries and result in the generation of count matrices. An obstacle to these analyses and the acquisition of meaningful results is that they require programing expertise. Although some effort has been directed toward the development of user-friendly RNA-Seq analysis analysis tools, few have the flexibility to explore both Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing. BingleSeq was developed as an intuitive application that provides a user-friendly solution for the analysis of count matrices produced by both Bulk and Single-cell RNA-Seq experiments. This was achieved by building an interactive dashboard-like user interface which incorporates three state-of-the-art software packages for each type of the aforementioned analyses. Furthermore, BingleSeq includes additional features such as visualization techniques, extensive functional annotation analysis and rank-based consensus for differential gene analysis results. As a result, BingleSeq puts some of the best reviewed and most widely used packages and tools for RNA-Seq analyses at the fingertips of biologists with no programing experience. BingleSeq is as an easy-to-install R package available on GitHub at https://github.com/dbdimitrov/BingleSeq/.	278	0.7611225188227242	2	56	0	0	24.996
10.7717/peerj.10670	FALSE	FALSE	Digital Cell Sorter (DCS): a cell type identification, anomaly detection, and Hopfield landscapes toolkit for single-cell transcriptomics	2021-01-13	Analysis of singe cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) typically consists of different steps including quality control, batch correction, clustering, cell identification and characterization, and visualization. The amount of scRNA-seq data is growing extremely fast, and novel algorithmic approaches improving these steps are key to extract more biological information. Here, we introduce: (i) two methods for automatic cell type identification (i.e., without expert curator) based on a voting algorithm and a Hopfield classifier, (ii) a method for cell anomaly quantification based on isolation forest, and (iii) a tool for the visualization of cell phenotypic landscapes based on Hopfield energy-like functions. These new approaches are integrated in a software platform that includes many other state-of-the-art methodologies and provides a self-contained toolkit for scRNA-seq analysis. We present a suite of software elements for the analysis of scRNA-seq data. This Python-based open source software, Digital Cell Sorter (DCS), consists in an extensive toolkit of methods for scRNA-seq analysis. We illustrate the capability of the software using data from large datasets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as well as plasma cells of bone marrow samples from healthy donors and multiple myeloma patients. We test the novel algorithms by evaluating their ability to deconvolve cell mixtures and detect small numbers of anomalous cells in PBMC data. The DCS toolkit is available for download and installation through the Python Package Index (PyPI). The software can be deployed using the Python import function following installation. Source code is also available for download on Zenodo: DOI 10.5281/zenodo.2533377. Supplemental Materials are available at PeerJ online.	256	0.7008898015058179	5	34	2	0.0078125	4.75
10.7717/peerj.12087	FALSE	FALSE	SC-JNMF: single-cell clustering integrating multiple quantification methods based on joint non-negative matrix factorization	2021-08-27	Single-cell RNA-sequencing is a rapidly evolving technology that enables us to understand biological processes at unprecedented resolution. Single-cell expression analysis requires a complex data processing pipeline, and the pipeline is divided into two main parts: The quantification part, which converts the sequence information into gene-cell matrix data; the analysis part, which analyzes the matrix data using statistics and/or machine learning techniques. In the analysis part, unsupervised cell clustering plays an important role in identifying cell types and discovering cell diversity and subpopulations. Identified cell clusters are also used for subsequent analysis, such as finding differentially expressed genes and inferring cell trajectories. However, single-cell clustering using gene expression profiles shows different results depending on the quantification methods. Clustering results are greatly affected by the quantification method used in the upstream process. In other words, even if the original RNA-sequence data is the same, gene expression profiles processed by different quantification methods will produce different clusters. In this article, we propose a robust and highly accurate clustering method based on joint non-negative matrix factorization (joint-NMF) by utilizing the information from multiple gene expression profiles quantified using different methods from the same RNA-sequence data. Our joint-NMF can extract common factors among multiple gene expression profiles by applying each NMF under the constraint that one of the factorized matrices is shared among multiple NMFs. The joint-NMF determines more robust and accurate cell clustering results by leveraging multiple quantification methods compared to conventional clustering methods, which use only a single gene expression profile. Additionally, we showed the usefulness of discovering marker genes with the extracted features using our method.	30	0.08213552361396304	4	41	0	0	3.35
10.7717/peerj.6970	FALSE	FALSE	Detection of condition-specific marker genes from RNA-seq data with MGFR	2019-05-27	The identification of condition-specific genes is key to advancing our understanding of cell fate decisions and disease development. Differential gene expression analysis (DGEA) has been the standard tool for this task. However, the amount of samples that modern transcriptomic technologies allow us to study, makes DGEA a daunting task. On the other hand, experiments with low numbers of replicates lack the statistical power to detect differentially expressed genes. We have previously developed MGFM, a tool for marker gene detection from microarrays, that is particularly useful in the latter case. Here, we have adapted the algorithm behind MGFM to detect markers in RNA-seq data. MGFR groups samples with similar gene expression levels and flags potential markers of a sample type if their highest expression values represent all replicates of this type. We have benchmarked MGFR against other methods and found that its proposed markers accurately characterize the functional identity of different tissues and cell types in standard and single cell RNA-seq datasets. Then, we performed a more detailed analysis for three of these datasets, which profile the transcriptomes of different human tissues, immune and human blastocyst cell types, respectively. MGFR’s predicted markers were compared to gold-standard lists for these datasets and outperformed the other marker detectors. Finally, we suggest novel candidate marker genes for the examined tissues and cell types. MGFR is implemented as a freely available Bioconductor package (https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.MGFR), which facilitates its use and integration with bioinformatics pipelines.	853	2.3353867214236823	5	38	2	0.0023446658851113715	3
10.7717/peerj.8275	FALSE	FALSE	Algorithms for efficiently collapsing reads with Unique Molecular Identifiers	2019-12-16	Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMI) are used in many experiments to find and remove PCR duplicates. There are many tools for solving the problem of deduplicating reads based on their finding reads with the same alignment coordinates and UMIs. However, many tools either cannot handle substitution errors, or require expensive pairwise UMI comparisons that do not efficiently scale to larger datasets. We reformulate the problem of deduplicating UMIs in a manner that enables optimizations to be made, and more efficient data structures to be used. We implement our data structures and optimizations in a tool called UMICollapse, which is able to deduplicate over one million unique UMIs of length 9 at a single alignment position in around 26 s, using only a single thread and much less than 10 GB of memory. We present a new formulation of the UMI deduplication problem, and show that it can be solved faster, with more sophisticated data structures.	650	1.7796030116358659	1	22	2	0.003076923076923077	5
10.7717/peerj.8607	FALSE	FALSE	SCelVis: exploratory single cell data analysis on the desktop and in the cloud	2020-02-19	Single cell omics technologies present unique opportunities for biomedical and life sciences from lab to clinic, but the high dimensional nature of such data poses challenges for computational analysis and interpretation. Furthermore, FAIR data management as well as data privacy and security become crucial when working with clinical data, especially in cross-institutional and translational settings. Existing solutions are either bound to the desktop of one researcher or come with dependencies on vendor-specific technology for cloud storage or user authentication. To facilitate analysis and interpretation of single-cell data by users without bioinformatics expertise, we present SCelVis, a flexible, interactive and user-friendly app for web-based visualization of pre-processed single-cell data. Users can survey multiple interactive visualizations of their single cell expression data and cell annotation, define cell groups by filtering or manual selection and perform differential gene expression, and download raw or processed data for further offline analysis. SCelVis can be run both on the desktop and cloud systems, accepts input from local and various remote sources using standard and open protocols, and allows for hosting data in the cloud and locally. We test and validate our visualization using publicly available scRNA-seq data. SCelVis is implemented in Python using Dash by Plotly. It is available as a standalone application as a Python package, via Conda/Bioconda and as a Docker image. All components are available as open source under the permissive MIT license and are based on open standards and interfaces, enabling further development and integration with third party pipelines and analysis components.
